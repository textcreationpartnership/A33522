            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THis diſcourſe was at firſt intended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the private uſe of our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; but by the requeſt of ſome, it is now comming into publique view, and ſo to thy hand. When the ſeed was firſt ſown here, the Lord was pleaſed to give a bleſſed hanſell of his grace, and ſome ſprinklings of firſt fruits thereof: may he now pleaſe to bleſs the produce of that ſeed, which now is ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in a large field, with a more plentifull harveſt-bleſſing in thy heart in ſpeciall, and
<pb facs="tcp:46944:3"/> in hearts of many others, by thy means, the unworthy ſeeds-man ſhall account himſelf well appayed, and abundantly rewarded. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the ſubject perſons firſtly concerned in the diſcourſe, are all ſorts of perſons, ſtanding in the relation of children, and ſo children in years alſo, as well as perſons of riper Age, ſo the ſtile and phraſe is familiar and plain: children needing no ſuch high-flown, quaint, &amp; new-coyned words as are even too much in uſe, now adayes, both in Preſs and Pulpit; but rather the plaineſt expreſſions, and eaſieſt to be underſtood. Onely remember alſo, Courteous Reader, that under the notion of children, in the diſcourſe, are underſtood, all ſuch as are in the relation of children, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Adult perſons, or children in Age; thou maieſt alſo, Chriſtian Reader, frequently meet with the very ſame Scriptures quoted in the diſcourſe, but let not that offend thee, ſince for thy benefit, thoſe rich veines of ſpirituall mine, are but further ſearched into, to find out yet more and more treaſure, according as there is various need, and vſe thereof; and thoſe lively Oracles of God are often conſulted withall, to ſee what further of the Lords mind they hold forth, in variety of Caſes. The main heads alſo of the diſcourſe, they are obvious to every eye, touched upon by divers expoſitors
<pb facs="tcp:46944:3"/> upon the Commandements, and hinted alſo in many worthy Catechiſes: but neither let this be any ſtumbling block to thee, but peruſe this diſcourſe alſo, and read it over with a teacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart; and thou maieſt find (I truſt, through grace) ſome peculiar bleſſing ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Lord, even upon this diſcourſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Who knoweth not, that mans dull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull heart, will not oftimes be moved with generals, and common heads of holy doctrine, or practice, lightly touched upon, but when drawn out into particulars, and thoſe being diſtinctly handled, wiſely applyed, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged and preſſed upon the conſcience, the ſtrong holds of ſin and Satan, in man, come to be thrown down, through the power of God accompanying the ſame; every deceitfull rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of mans heart is met withall, and refuted; and every high thing in man, which did formerly exalt it ſelf againſt Chriſt, is, by grace, captivated and ſubdued. Surely, if the plain matters herein diſcourſed of, may have that privilege, in reference to the ſoul, which meats of more common and ordinary uſe have, in reſpect to the body, namely to nouriſh moſt, and to breed the beſt blood, the diſcourſe will attain one ſpeciall end thereof. The ſubject of this diſcourſe (Chriſtian Reader) it is, in the naturo thereof, Oeconomicall, reſpecting the
<pb facs="tcp:46944:4"/> Family, ſpecially; but in the conſequences and concernments thereof, it may not be unfitly termed. Politicall, yea Eccleſiaſticall; as that, namely which very nearly reſpecteth, and concerneth the welfare of State and Church. The glorious creator of all things, having abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Spirit, he could at firſt, and at once, have made millions of people, who might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently have conſtituted civill ſtates and Churches alſo: but he choſe that courſe rather, to lay the foundations both of State and Church, in a family, making that the Mother Hive, out of which both thoſe ſwarms of State and Church, iſſued forth. And as he begun both State and Church Entitative and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, in <hi>Adams</hi> Family; ſo, when God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would inſtitute a more compleat and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick Church, and Common-wealth, he laid the foundations of both in the Family of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Jacob;</hi> the Originall Family of all, conſiſting of Parents and Children, firſtly; then of Maſters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants nextly. The originall then of State and Church being the Family, they are both, in that reſpect, concerned in it; yea as the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is an Originall to States and Churches, in their Eſſentials, ſo alſo in their Morals, in their manners. As that Nurſery is better or worſe, and the plants thereof of more or leſs
<pb facs="tcp:46944:4"/> worth, ſo are both the Orchards of State and Church, <hi>(Cantic.</hi> 4. 12.) which are thence ſtored with Trees, better or worſe, and their fruits more or leſs wholſome; if that School be but well ordered, and the leſſer Scholars in it well principled and grounded, <hi>(Prov.</hi> 4. 4.) thoſe which afterwards come to be made uſe of, for more eminent uſe and ſervice, in State and Church, they will be the more precious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments to them both; if that leſſer Artillery Company of Trained Perſons <hi>(Gen.</hi> 14. 14.) be but well looked after and mannaged, the Commanders, and File-leaders, which iſſue thence, into thoſe greater Armies of State, <hi>(Job.</hi> 29. 25.) and of Church, <hi>(Cantic.</hi> 6. 4.) they commonly prove more famous in their Achievements and exploits. As the waters at that wel-head of State and Church, are more or leſs pure or wholſome, bitter or ſweet, ſo are they uſually of like ſort, in thoſe ſtreams of State and Church, which borrow their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ſupply from that ſpring, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 7. And Oh that the Lord would ſo far bleſs this diſcourſe, that it might become inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to the healing of any naughty waters, of any ſuch ſprings; as ſometimes he did of that at <hi>Jericho,</hi> by means of <hi>Eliſhas</hi> caſting of Salt thereinto, (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 21, 22.) that there might be no more ſuch ſpirituall death
<pb facs="tcp:46944:5"/> and barrenneſs, as is chiefly occaſioned in Church and State, by corruptions in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in theſe declining and degenerating dayes. Something, no doubt, is amiſs in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſomething in Children; both may hence have healing, if the Lord but ſpeak the word; with him therefore I leave this my poor indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and unto him and to his grace I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee, Chriſtian Reader, reſting,</p>

               <p>Touching the other word, Honour: It is to be <note place="margin">What is meant by Honour Even,</note> conſidered both in generall, and in a reſtrained ſenſe. All meet honour, and every kind of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar honour, being due from Children to Parents, The Lord doth not ſay, love thy Father, and thy Mother, or fear them, or obey them, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them, or be an honour to them: any one of theſe being too narrow, to reach ſo large a duty, as parentall relations call for from their children, and each of theſe being ſeparable from the other, and may be in other relations, where all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are not ſo properly requiſite; yet no one of theſe are excluded, but all, and every of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the notion of Honour. Filiall Honour is the center wherein they all meet, and whence again they are all drawn out to their reſpective objects, Father and Mother. Filiall honour muſt ſeaſon them, each muſt ſavour of Honour. Filial Honour muſt regulate them all; they muſt go ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46944:9"/> far as that goeth, and no further. Filial honour <note place="margin">Honour in the Generall, and Honour in ſpeciall, both</note> muſt be their common ſtamp, the impreſſion whereof, each muſt bear. Due Filial honour muſt be their touchſtone, by which they muſt receive their triall.</p>
               <p>Honour then in the Generall is Parents due from their children. So is Honour in ſpeciall; whether that which is more direct, or that which is in a more reflect way.</p>
               <p>Honour in a direct way is, in Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <note place="margin">1. Direct,</note> fourfold; even Honour, Firſt, of Reſpect, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of Reverence, Thirdly, of Obedience, Fourthly, of Recompence; and are all and each of them included in this generall term, Honour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Honour of high Reſpect and love is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <note place="margin">as 1.

So here, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> i. e. highly priſe and reſpect, and moſt dearly love thy Father &amp; thy mother, yea ſo as it be in a way of Honour to them as Parents, and not barely as others, not ſo nearly related.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Honour is taken in Scripture for Honour of Reverence and fear. So when God ſpeaketh of <note place="margin">2. Honour of Reverence.</note> his Honour, as to a Maſter, he calleth it fear, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>if I am a Maſter, where is my fear?</hi> or Honour as a Maſter; hence that of <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30. <hi>Yet Honour me before the people;</hi> or let
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46944:9"/> the people ſee that thou doeſt reverence me. Hence that <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 32. <hi>honour the face of the old man,</hi> i. e. reverence it. So here, <hi>Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy Mother</hi> i. e. reverence and awe them, in an honourable way to them as Parents, and not as others meerly, not ſo nearly related.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Honour is taken in Scripture, for Honour of <note place="margin">3. Honour of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> Obedience.

                  <note place="margin">2.

               <p>Honour in a Reflect way, is to be ſuch,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46944:10"/> or to carry it ſo, as may redound to anothers Honour, whom we are bound to Honour. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 30. <hi>Honour me before the people,</hi> i. e. carry it ſo before them, as may not redound to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, but honour.

               <p>The promiſe followeth, [That thy daies <note place="margin">The promiſe explained.</note> may belong in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee] this further declareth who are firſtly concerned in the precept; namely, ſuch whoſe God the Lord is in ſpeciall ſort, ſuch like as the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to whom this land was firſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly promulged, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. is expreſſed: who were a people in eſpeciall Covenant with God, children of God, and of the Church, and of the Covenant: who profeſſed to look, not for a Portion in this world, ſo much as by that Land of promiſe to be led to a more ſpirituall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Canaan and reſt, of which that earthly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan was but a ſhadow, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. though this Law being given to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, and ingraven

In this promiſe, he doth not ſay, that thy life may be long in the world, but that thy dayes may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee; which to the Jews was the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to others, the Land of their poſſeſſion, wherein, if honourers of Parents, children ſhall live long, if good for them; or if ordered by God to live leſs while, they ſhall have the bleſſing of long life. And ſo much for expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the words; the doctrine which we ſhall (through divine Aſſiſtance) proſecute is this.</p>
               <p>That children Honour their Parents; It is a duty <note place="margin">The main doctrine. The weight of the duty of Honour of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents proved.</note> of greateſt moment and concernment.</p>
               <p>Let us firſt evince the weightineſs of this duty, and then more fully handle the duty it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Four reaſons, amongſt many, may be given to prove the weight of this duty, Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy Mother.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is placed by the Law-giver himſelf <note place="margin">1. Becauſe next in order to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the firſt Table, and before the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſecond Table.</note> immediately next to the commandements of the 1. Table, as next in order to them, and before all the other Commandements of the 2. Table, as in order of duty, and dignity, preceding the ſame. It is made a ſweet cloſure, bond, and ſementing to both Tables, binding and faſtning each to other inviolably, and inſeparably. As this is more faſt or looſe; ſo are mens ſpirits more girt to the duties of both Tables, or more looſe from them. He that conſcientiouſly honoureth his Parents, he is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly conſcientious of honouring of God, in the firſt place, and his Parents for conſcience ſake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Piety to God-ward, as a cauſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46944:11"/> in him, to this bleſſed duty, piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Parents, as to its effect. And therefore the Lord doth not without cauſe ſtile the duty of Children to Parents, by the name of piety, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4. let them learn of ſhew piety to them at home, and to requite their Parents; Piety being in the root, it is piety in the fruit, yea this bleſſed fruit, is a furthering means alſo, to promove all the acts of piety, which ſpring out of that root; if Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren honour their Parents fully, and as they ought, they will, in obſervance of their Parents counſels and commands, be more carefull of whatſoever God commandeth, reſpecting the firſt or ſecond Table: hence that for the firſt Table, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 3. <hi>Ye ſhall fear every man his Mother, and every man his Father, and keep my Sabbaths,</hi> where under the notion of Gods Sabbaths kept, not alone the obſervation of the Sabbath it ſelf is underſtood, but, as in Scripture language, the whole worſhip of God is meant; So <hi>Eſay</hi> 56. 4. <hi>the Eunuches that keep my Sabbaths,</hi> i. e. obſerve my whole worſhip; ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 24. ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 24. deſpiſing and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting his Sabboths, is deſpiſing and polluting his worſhip: hence that is there added<hi>—and their eyes are towards their Idols.</hi> Obſervable it is alſo, that in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 2. God ſaith, <hi>be ye holy, as I am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and then addeth <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>ye ſhall fear every man his Mother, and his Father;</hi> From that piety, originally ſpringeth this: yet again annexeth to this, <hi>ye ſhall keep my Sabbaths.</hi> In the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, that is firſt, Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath: and then, Honour thy Father, and thy Mother. Here it is, Fear every man his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Father, and keep my Sabbaths; that Radicall piety being laid in the heart, now this other piety, exceedingly furthereth the exerciſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46944:11"/> of particular acts of piety towards God; one pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards Parents, will be carefull of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall worſhip, to call upon God, to love him, to fear him, &amp; to put his truſt in him, required in the 1. Commandement; he wil conſcientiouſly obſerve all Gods inſtituted worſhip, avoiding all worſhip of mens inventing, according to the tenour of the 2. Commandement; he will reverently, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improve Gods attributes, titles, words, and works, avoiding the contrary abuſe thereof, as it is injoyned in the 3. Commandement; he will alſo as faithfully, and fruitfully ſanctifie the Lords dayes, reſting from the works of his calling, and eſpecially from vain ſports, which is that which the 4. Commandement requireth: the like may be ſaid of the Commandements of the 2. table, which will all be duly attended, if this duty of the fifth Commandem. be faithfully obſerved; both are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in that place (of which we ſhall make much uſe in this diſcourſe) <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>I know</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>that he will command his children,—and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice;</hi> if <hi>Abrahams</hi> children honour his parentall Authority, ſo that they are at his command, then they keep the way of the Lord, then they do judgement and juſtice; whatſoever path, God chalketh out for them to walk in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, or towards men, they will be keeping in it. And indeed, who better ſervants, in that relation, to Maſters, then thoſe that were good children to Parents? who more obedient ſubjects to lawfull Authority, and Fathers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, then ſuch as learned and practiſed filiall obedience to Parents, at home? who more reſpective to Miniſters, then thoſe that were, and are conſcientiouſly reſpective to good Parents?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46944:12"/> who more tender of their own, and others lives and healths, of their own and others chaſtity, of their own and others eſtates and names, avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the contrary evills, to a very ſinfull motion looking that way, then ſuch as have been Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious honourers of their Parents? hence, on the contrary, diſhonour of Parents is made a Ring-leading ſin, a very ſpring and root of manifold wickedneſs. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 7. when the Prophet would charge upon all ſorts in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> their moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious crimes, he beginneth thus, <hi>In thee have they ſet light by Father and Mother:</hi> and then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on, <hi>in the midſt of thee have they dealt by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion with the ſtranger, in thee have they vexed the fatherleſs and widow.</hi> Ibid. <hi>thou haſt deſpiſed mine holy things, and haſt profaned my Sabbaths,</hi> verſe 8. <hi>In thee are men that carry tales to ſhed blood,</hi> verſ. 9.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46944:12"/> given to thoſe, or to any other vices, to which looſe and lewd companions will readily draw them. Surely it is juſtly to be feared, to be too much our caſe in New <hi>England,</hi> where many of the youth grow ſo rude and profane, ſo regardleſs of Superiours, in the family, as maſters, in the State, as Magiſtrates, in the Church, as Elders: where many of them are ſo vainly given, ſo looſe in their company, ſo proud, and ſupercilious in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, ſo new-fangled in their faſhions, and ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fianly in their hair, nay jearers, many of them, at the beſt perſons and things, in a word, where is ſo little yet appearing of God, or good, in too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them; I ſay it is juſtly to be feared, that children here are not honourers of Parents. Here Parents are commonly put more to it, to make uſe of their childrens hands and help, and ſo children here being naturally apt to count too much upon what they do for Parents, they are as apt to ſet the more light by them, and by their inſtructions, and admonitions, and ſo an open way is made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to any other wickedneſs amongſt them. Hence alſo malefactors, when at the Gallows they have made their dying Confeſſions, they have laid on hardeſt upon this ſin, as the riſe of thoſe which brought them at length to that ſad end, that they regarded not their Fathers, they deſpiſed their Mothers, were unruly, and diſobedient Children to their Parents; Ah, will ſome then ſay, the good counſels which our fathers, or our mothers gave us, but, wretches that we were, we would never hearken to them, nor regard them. Let all good people take warning by us, and let all young men or women that hear us, for ever take heed, by our example, how you deſpiſe your Parents, or ſlight their Counſels, or rebukes.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:46944:13"/>
               <p> The ſecond reaſon is taken from the law and <note place="margin">2. Becauſe this is made of ſuch weight by the Law and light of nature and of nations</note> light of nature and nations, which have put a like weight upon this duty of Honour of Parents, making it as next to the honour of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Pythoragus,</hi> having given the priority to the worſhip of the Gods (as the poor Pagan cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—It is in ſhort but thus. Firſt, honour nour God, as by the Law is appointed, then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Parents. And mind his ſpeech, that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this by Law appointed: even by the Law of nature and nations; For no other Law had theſe Heathens.

So <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> in his Admonitory Oration to <hi>Demonicus,</hi> counſelleth and chargeth him thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.

But our glorious Lord and Law-giver to ſhew the great weight of this duty, he will not leave it to be inforced by natures Law or light on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he will adde his morall ſanction of it, as his own promulged Law, and he will not doe it in more obſcure termes, or ſo as only to be drawn by Conſequence, but this ſhall be expreſſed in ſo many words; It ſhall be written as in Capitall Letters, that every one that runneth may read it, and none may plead excuſe or exemption; yea the Command it ſelf ſhall be expreſſed in ſo few and ſo familiar words, that the leaſt Child, who can remember any thing, ſhall be able to remember this, and even with its milk, almoſt, drink in this principle of Honour of Parents.</p>

               <p>HAving explained the words of the 5. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, &amp; ſhewn the weight of the duty therein injoyned to Children; we now come to make further inquiry into the duty it ſelf, which we ſhall conſider of, in the method propounded. 1. More Generally. 2. More particulaly. Firſt then of Honour of Parents in a generall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, wherein we ſhall, 1. Conſider what kind and manner of honour, this honour of Parents,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46944:14"/> ſo generally conſidered, muſt be. 2. Make ſome uſes thereof. To the firſt inquiry we anſwer, 1. <note place="margin">Honour not due to Parents which is, 1. In way of diſhoner to God.</note> Negatively, what Honour is not due to Parents; 2. Affirmatively, what manner of Honour is due; In a negative way we ſay the Honour of Parents</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt not be in any way of diſhonour to God, either by ſinnes of Omiſſion or of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Children muſt not ſo reſpect, eſteem, and love Father or Mother, as to love, and prefer them in their reſpects to the Lord. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 37. Children may not be ſo tranſported with affection to Parents, as thereby to be hindered from a call of Chriſt, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon it. As he in <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 65. when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to follow Chriſt, would have gon firſt and buried his Father, but <hi>verſ.</hi> 60. is anſwered by Chriſt, <hi>Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the Kingdome of God;</hi> or as the other in <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 61. that would ingage to follow Chriſt, but he would firſt bid farewell to thoſe at home, namely, Parents, Kindred, &amp;c. But Jeſus Chriſt accounteth ſuch inordinacy of affection, in thoſe who profeſſe to ſet their faces towards heaven, to be a looking back to the world, and the like, and therefore <hi>verſ.</hi> 62. <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>No man having put his hand to the Plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdome of God.</hi> Children may not have ſuch carnall affection to Parents, or be ſo glued to them, as not to be able to part with them, and forſake them, and deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in them, for the ſake of Chriſt, when they are thereunto called. The Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Antitype, muſt forget her Kindred, and Fathers houſe, for her <hi>Lords</hi> ſake, and nearer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 10. Children may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46944:15"/> not ſo love Father or Mother, as out of reſpect to them, to forſake Chriſts truth, or faith, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any thing contrary to the faith or truth of Chriſt, (a ſin too common amongſt the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and other <hi>Heretiques</hi> and <hi>Opinion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts)</hi> this is alſo to love them more then Chriſt. Better that the Daughter, in ſuch a caſe of Chriſts faith and truth, be at variance againſt the Mother, that ſhe contend, even with her, for Chriſts truth, for the faith once delivered to the Saints, that ſhe beat down with all her might the Mothers errors and evils. In which caſe alſo, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 35. <hi>He commeth to ſet a man at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt his own Father, and the Daughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Mother.</hi> He that more deſireth after his Parents preſence, then after the Lords, or more delighteth in them, then in the Lord himſelf, or is more moved in their cauſes, then in the Lords, or is more troubled for them, and their diſgrace, then for the Lords diſhonour, or the like, he doth not honour his Parents according to Gods mind and heart; yea, he that comparatively, and where the love of Father or Mother, and the love of Chriſt, are not compatible, where the condition and caſe is ſo qualified, that love to Parents, and love to Chriſt, become flat contraries, and muſt one give place to the other, one or the other muſt be laid aſide, in ſuch a caſe, <hi>He that hateth not his very Father and Mother, cannot be Chriſts Diſciple,</hi> Luk. 14. 26. In ſuch a caſe Godly zealous <hi>Levi</hi> is commended, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 9. Who ſaid to his Father and his Mother, I have not ſeen him. The like might be ſaid in that honour of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Fear; Children may not be ſo afraid of Parents, or of their frownes, or blowes, or diſtaſtes, or disinheritings, &amp;c. as not to be afraid
<pb facs="tcp:46944:15"/> of Gods diſpleaſure, but to adventure that in ſome way of ſin, rather then run the hazzard of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Children muſt indeed honour their Parents Counſels and Commands with the honour of obedience and obſervance, yet not ſo as in a way of diſhonour to God, to neglect what he requireth, or to do any thing which he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> is branded for this, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 3. That he walked in the waies of the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> for his Mother was his counſellour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt not be in way of Inaequality to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parent. The Father is not to be preferred <note place="margin">2. With In e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parents.</note> by the Child as a Child, before the Mother; or the Mother more loved, reverenced, obeyed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed then the Father. The Parents are equally Parents, and equall cauſes of the Children, and ſo by the law of nature, as Parents, they are to ſhare equally in the honour of ſuch inſtrumentall cauſes of the be ing of their Children. Hence though in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>[Honour thy Father and thy Mother]</hi> the Father is ſet before the Mother, yet in <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 3. (which is an expoſition of the 5.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46944:16"/> Commandement) the Mother is ſet before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>[Yee ſhall fear every man his Mother, &amp; every man his Father]</hi> to ſhew, that the Father being ſet before the Mother, for honour, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth fear; and the Mother being ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father, for fear, which is a ſpeciall branch of honour; they are both alike for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the generall, and for fear in ſpeciall. This, <hi>Willet</hi> in his ſixfold Commentary upon <hi>Leviticus;</hi> and <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in his notes upon <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 3. They both do note from <hi>Maimony.</hi> So <hi>Muſculus</hi> in his common places, and expoſition of this fifth Commandement, he noteth; <q>that Gods command is for <hi>honouring,</hi> not the Father onely, but the Mother: God ſaith not, <hi>Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but addeth, <hi>and thy Mother;</hi> the Mother indeed is the Fathers inferiour, according to the Law of conjugall ſubjection, and likewiſe ſhe is by nature, and Sex, the weaker veſſell; but the Child is not thence to draw an argument, that he muſt think the more deſpicably of his Mother; for that difference that is made in wedlock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the husband, and the wife, appertaineth not to him, but he muſt look to that relation, which is betwixt Mother and Son; what ever ſhe be, in reſpect of her husband, to thee ſhe is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and together with thy Father to be equally honoured; ſince that for this, that thou might'ſt be born, ſhe did equally cooperate, yea rather much more; for who can weigh ſufficiently, what a heap of troubles, the womb big with Child bringeth along with it? how great are the ſorrows of bringing forth? how many and great are the perils? ſo that it is not in vain ſaid, <hi>in ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth.</hi> Laſtly how cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome is the ſuckling of the Child, and the care
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46944:16"/> of it, whil'ſt in the Cradle? ſo that they greatly ſin, which transfer all the Honour due in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to their Parents, unto their Father onely, and care not how they ſet by their Mothers, ſo they can but gratifie their Father;</q> thus far <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus;</hi> and verily in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 8. Both are given in equall charge: <hi>My Son, hear the inſtruction of thy Father; and forſake not the Law of thy Mother;</hi> ſo in <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>My Son, keep thy Fathers Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; and forſake not the Law of thy Mother.</hi> And why elſe is there an equall reward, even long life, equally promiſed to the Honour of Mothers, as to that of Fathers, if the Honour of the one be not equall to that of the other? or why elſe is the diſhonour of the Mother, as well as of the Father, equally put under the ſame curſe? <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 16. <hi>Curſed be he that ſetteth light by his Father, or his Mother, and all the people ſhall ſay,</hi> Amen. Or why is the ſame puniſhment of Juſtice to be equally inflicted for ſmiting the Mother, as well as the Father, being made equally death, <hi>Ex.</hi> 20. 15. or for curſing the Mother, as well as the Father, or for ſtubbornneſs, in not obeying the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers voice, as well as the Fathers, being alſo equally made deaht, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 18, 19, 20, 21. If the Honour of the Mother, by the Childe, be not equall to that of the Father? where there is, by God himſelf, one and the ſame reward of grace equally promiſed, as to the Honour, and the ſame puniſhment of Juſtice equally threatned, as to the diſhonour, as well of the Mother, as of the Father, there is the ſame Honour equally due, by the will of God, to the Mother, as is to the Father; but to the former Scriptures ſhew, that God equally promiſeth the ſame reward of grace
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46944:17"/> to the Childs Honour, and equally threatens the ſame puniſhment of Juſtice, to the Childs diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as well of the Mother, as of the Father; therefore the Honour due, according to God, from the Child as a Child, to his Mother, as is to his Father, is equall and equally due.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It muſt not be a bare pretended, and formall <note place="margin">3. Meerly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall and in pretence one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> kind of Honour of Parents. Such was that in <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who feignedly pretendeth ſuch Honour of reſpect to his Father, that he had rather die, then not to be reconciled to his Father, and enjoy his Fathers favour, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 32. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Joab,) am I come up from</hi> Geſhur? <hi>It had been good for me to have been there ſtill: now therefore let me ſee the Kings face, and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me;</hi> but his deviliſh plot ſo ſoon after, againſt his Father <hi>(Chap.</hi> 15. 7. 10.) ſhewed, that all that, was but bare pretence, and not reality of reſpect to his Father. So in that young man, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to Chriſt, that he had kept all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and ſo the fifth, inſtanced in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 19, 20. and that from his youth up, he had begun the practice of Honour of Father &amp; Mother betimes, and to that day continued it; but the iſſue ſhewed, that he never conſcientiouſly, ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and really, Honour'd his Father and Mother, but in a meer formal, and outſide way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, even in the ſame ſort, as he kept the other Commandements, being never the nearer entrance into heaven, notwithſtanding all that, like him, in the parable of the two ſons, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 28. 30. that pretendeth Honour of obedience to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for when his Father ſaith to him, <hi>Son, go to work to day in my Vineyard;</hi> he readily, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (in ſhew at leaſt) anſwereth, <hi>I go Sir, but went not.</hi> It was onely pretence, and diſſimulation.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:46944:17"/> 4. Look that it be not a baſe ſelfiſh, ſelf-ended <note place="margin">4. Meerly Selfiſh.</note> Honouring of Father, or Mother, for hope of gain by them, and ſo making much of them, whil'ſt ſome requeſts, or deſires of the Child are anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, his ends furthered, or fulfilled; ſome large Portions gotten out of their hands, or large fleeces gain'd out of their outward eſtates; like the yonger Son in the parable, that will be giving his Father's Titles of Honour, whil'ſt he hath fingred his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as he calleth it,) <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 12 <hi>[Father] give me my Portion;</hi> but <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>not many day after, he gathereth up all he hath, and leaveth his Father.</hi> Now his Father is not in ſuch requeſt with him; the Text ſaith, he took his journey, but not a word of this, that he asketh his Father leave, or asketh his Fathers advice that way: <hi>Father ſhall I take ſuch a journey?</hi> no verily, let his Father like it, or diſlike it, he now careth not, he hath gotten what he looked for from him, and now fare him well, he careth to be under his Fathers watch no more, he regardeth neither his Company, nor his Counſell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo <hi>Abſolom,</hi> Oh! his Fathers face and preſence, it is all in all to him, he cannot live without it, one would think, if he ſpeak his heart, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. <hi>let me ſee the Kings face—or if iniquity be in me, let him kill me,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. when permitted to come into his Fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>he boweth himſelf on his very face to the ground before him;</hi> what would you have more in a Son? ah! but all this was for baſe and by ends. <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loms</hi> ambitious deſignes, reaches, and ends, could not ſo well be furthered by living as retired, and exiled from the Court, though come to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> but at the Court, and near the place of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, whither the ſubjects from all parts of the Kingdome repair frequently for Juſtice, there he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46944:18"/> hath opportunity to lay his traines, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 2. without ſuſpition of any, he ſitteth by the gate, the place of judicature and reſort, and he asketh each one, of what tribe art thou? <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, <hi>look that thy matter be good and right:</hi> (As if he were very ſollicitous of Right twixt man and man:) but withall telleth them, <hi>there is none deputed by the King to hear thee.</hi> Now he beginneth cloſely to ſcatter ſeeds of prejudice, and diſcontent in the ſubjects againſt the preſent government ſet over them: then <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. wiſheth in their hearing, <hi>Oh that I were Judge in the Land, that every man which hath any ſute or cauſe, might come to me, and I would do him Juſtice:</hi> now he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a good word for himſelf to be thought of, and put in ſome chief place in the ſtate, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. every ſubject that cometh near him muſt have his hand, he muſt take him, he muſt imbrace him, and kiſs him; and no wonder that now he hath, as <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>even ſtollen away the hearts of the men of</hi> Iſrael; Oh thinketh every one, what a worthy and hopefull Prince is this, how ſollicitous that every man do right, and have right done him! how marvellous kind, and condeſcending to the meaneſt ſubject, he would ſurely make us, in time, a very good King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>Abſolom</hi> hath plaid his game well thus far, it remaineth onely that <hi>Abſolom,</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at leaſt, give his Father the Honour of going by his leave to <hi>Hebron;</hi> a place fitteſt to hatch the Treaſon againſt his Father, which he hath been all that while brooding, and where that fire may flame out beſt, which he hath been kindling; this leave is eaſily gained from his Father, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8, 9. he hath 200 men to attend him to <hi>Hebron,</hi> and when thither come, <hi>Achitophel</hi> is ſent for, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy is ripened, and numbers of Aſſociates
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46944:18"/> daily increaſe, and good <hi>David</hi> ſoon perceiveth his miſtake in his Sons pretended ſubmiſſion and obeiſance. Yea but the fifth Commandment would cut off all ſuch Attractives to ſelfiſh Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Parents, and therefore ſaith, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> namely poor or rich, high or low, as well I that hath nothing to give, and leave thee, as that hath never ſo much: hence when Chriſt would ſhew upon what, as upon their bottome and baſis, all the commands of God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpecting God or men, do hang and depend, he ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 37, 38. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all tby heart;</hi> this is the firſt and great Commandement, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. the ſecond is like to this; <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. <hi>On theſe two Commandements hang all the Law, and the Prophets;</hi> thoſe are the two wel-ſprings of all obedience to the Law and word of God; and therefore all the particulars are reducible to thoſe two heads; if the Honour of reſpect, reverence, or obedience, which we give to God, be not from love to our ſelves, or to our own ends, but to himſelf, then it is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God indeed; ſo if our honour, which we give to our Parents, be not from love to our ſelves, but it is from intire love to them, that we ſhew forth ſuch reſpect, or reverence, or obedience, or thankfulneſs to them, now it is Honour of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents indeed. Again, as it muſt not be Honour of Parents from ſelf-love, as oppoſed to intire love of Parents, ſo it muſt not be from ſelf-love, as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to love of God; the love of whom eſpecially, ſhould put Children upon Honouring the Image of his Father-hood, in their Parents; hence in that, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 3. <hi>Ye ſhall fear every man his Mother and Father,</hi> why ſo? <hi>I am the Lord</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:46944:19"/> 
                  <hi>thy God;</hi> and ſo thy Father in Covenant, and Covenant-mercies and priviledges, a Father of mercies promiſed and offered to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore out of love to me, Honour, every one of you, his Parents. And as Childrens honour of Parents muſt not be ſelfiſh, in reference to love of ſelf-profit, and preferment, or the like, ſo neither in reference to love of ſelf-eaſe, or meer immunity from puniſhments, or corrections, in any contrary way of diſhonour; whether from Parents privately, or the civil Magiſtrate, publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if Childrens Honour of reverence, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which they outwardly hold forth, ſhould be extracted chiefly from the force of Parents auſtere carriage, or threats, or blows, or the dread of the correction from civill Authority, or the like, it is a ſlaviſh, and not a filiall Honouring of them; when <hi>Paul</hi> would expreſs, in a word, that <hi>Timothy</hi> ſerved with him in the Goſpel, neither formally, nor feignedly, nor ſelfiſhly, nor ſlaviſhly, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedly; but freely, ſincerely, and regularly; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it thus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>As the Son with the Father, he hath ſerved with me in the Goſpel;</hi> the Honour then of a Son to the Father is, or ſhould be, neither feigned, formall, ſelfiſh, nor ſlaviſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In an affirmative way, we ſay the Honour <note place="margin">Honour of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents muſt be 1. Cordiall.</note> of Parents,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be cordiall; not alone God, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt have each of his Childrens hearts, in all the Honour they give him, as his Sons and Daughters, but <hi>Solomon,</hi> as a Father, may groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly ſay, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 26. <hi>My Son, give me thy heart:</hi> namely, as that which muſt crown all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which thou my Son muſt give me as thy Father; thus <hi>Timothy</hi> ſerveth with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Goſpel, as with his Father, by grace, as an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46944:19"/> Son with his Father at any other work; namely, with all his heart, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be conſtant; as long as the relation <note place="margin">2. Conſtant.</note> holdeth firm twixt Parent and Child, which is as long as they Coexiſt in this world, and till one of the Relates are taken away by death, Parents from Children, or Children from Parents; they muſt obey this morall precept, which bindeth <hi>ſemper &amp; ad ſemper,</hi> alwaies and to all times; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy Father and Mother, hath no prefixed time ſet to it. It is not Honour thy Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whil'ſt a little one, whil'ſt a youth, whil'ſt ſo or ſo old, whil'ſt in a ſingle condition, or with the like limitations, no; but it is without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and limitation to ages, ſexes, conditions, places, relations, callings, imployments; it is for term of life, and that to which each one, Male or Female, younger or elder, married or unmarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, learned or unlearned, godly or ungodly, high or low, Prince or Peaſant, rich or poor is bound unto, hence alſo that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 22. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not thy Mother when ſhe is old:</hi> when ſhe was young, yea, when ſhe was middle aged, or the like, thou priſedſt, and reſpectedſt, and didſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and obey her, do it as well when ſhe is old; hold on doing of it, to the laſt. Age may wear and waſte a Mothers beauty, ſtrength, parts, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, limbs, eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but her relation of a Mother is as the Sun, when he goeth forth in his might, for the ever of this life, that is alwayes in its me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, and knoweth no evening; the perſon may be gray-headed, but her Motherly relation, is ever in its flouriſh.

For the Mariners lightning their ſhip, by caſting out the good wares in it, as forced by a ſtorm to do that, which had they done in another caſe, it had been manifeſt wrong, and injuſtice to the owners; of all others, Parents ſhould not be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pinched, and that by you, their own Children, of their juſt weight and meaſure, but rather have it upheaped, or preſſed down, or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over; if God in other caſes, would have no

               <p>A ſecond uſe of the point may ſerve for examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46944:31"/> whether any have or do rightly Honour their Parents. This is the rather to be conſidered, in that there is a formall Phariſaicall Honour of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: there is an Honour of Parents common not alone to Hypocrites, but to very <hi>Pagans</hi> alſo, who from meer naturall principles have done much this way in Honour of Parents, and have been very eminent and famous therein. But to paſſe them by at preſent, and inſtance in others. <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion was an exact Moraliſt, touching the letter of the Law, and ſo of the 5th Commandement, he was blameleſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6. So that young man, in his ſenſe, had kept all, and o the 5th Commandment, according to the letter of it, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 19, 20. Yet a meer unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon.</p>
               <p>Now if perſons, in the relation of Children rightly honour their Parents, it may be diſcerned <note place="margin">Marks of due honour of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> by ſuch markes as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If Conſcience to God, and to his command <note place="margin">1. If from a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> hath the greateſt ſtroak, in the Honour given to Parents, by their Children. If rightly honoured, they are honoured in the Lord, as in that branch of this Honour, it is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Children obey your Parents in the Lord.</hi> So it is true in Honour in generall, or in any other particular of Honour due to Parents, they muſt be reſpected, reverenced, and recompenced, &amp;c. <hi>in the Lord.</hi> Or ſo as it be from a good Conſcience, and may ſtand with a good Conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. the end (or ſcope) of the Commandement (even of the whole Law ſpecially that of the ſecond Table, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly this of the fifth Commandement alſo) is Love (to whom <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 37, 38, 39, 40. all the duties of the Law are referred as to their head) out of a pure heart, and a good Conſcience, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46944:32"/> faith unfeighned. True it is, the Law of nature and Nations alſo, may and muſt have a ſtrong hand in the Honour of Parents by their Children, but muſt not have the chief hand therein; reſpect may and muſt alſo be had, to the bleſſing of life, and that it may be well with us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 2, 3. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy Father and Mother, that thou maiſt live long, and that it may be well with thee:</hi> We may and muſt aime at this, that it may be well with us in our ſouls, bodies, eſtates, names, occaſions, relations, changes, proſperity, adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, life, death, and after death; but yet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and his command, together with chief reſpect had to the glory of God, muſt be the great wheel, which carrieth us on in this good way <hi>Paul</hi> thought to gain eternall life, by his Morall Righteouſneſs, &amp; that ſet him ſo hard to this, and other works of the Law, <hi>Ph.</hi> 3. 6, 7. The yong mans queſtion, intimateth what was uppermoſt in his heart, in all his keepings of the Law, namely, the getting of eternall life onely, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 17, 19, 20. And therefore theſe were notright in any of their acts of obedience to this fifth Commandement, or to any of the reſt of the ten Commandements.</p>
               <p>Now if this Honour to Parents be indeed from a good conſcience, it will be alſo from faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned: <note place="margin">This is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if from Faith,</note> for they are joyned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. When the intereſt which children have in the Lord, and in his gracious covenant and promiſes, is a main ground of the Honour of Reverence, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Honour, which perſons as in the Relation of Children, do give unto their Mother, or to their Father, this is ſuitable to Gods mind, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 3. <hi>Ye ſhall fear every man his Mother, and every man his Father;</hi> why ſo? or what ſhould move them to that? it followeth: <hi>I am the Lord your God.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46944:32"/> they believe him to be their bleſſed Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Father in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> they are therefore the rather to put all the Honour they can upon the Image of his Father-hood in their Parents. Now it is as God would have it. So when perſons as in <note place="margin">If from love of God.</note> the relation of Children do reſpect, priſe and love their Chriſtian Parents the more, becauſe they love the Lord, who requireth this at their hand, now it is well a ſo; or when an holy fear attendeth them, leſt not alone their good Parents hearts, <note place="margin">If from fear of Sin.</note> but leſt the Lord alſo, and his Spirit, ſhould any way be grieved, or diſpleaſed by their expreſſing, or carrying it towards them in any way contrary to due Honour of Parents; they are afraid to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it irreverently, diſobediently, diſreſpectfully, or ingratefully towards them, even when ſome way tempted thereto, leſt the eyes of Gods glory ſhould thereby be provoked, now alſo it is well. Or when at any time they eſpie any diſhonourable <note place="margin">If kindly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when the contrary in them is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> thought, or ſtirring in their minds, or ſpirits, or take notice of ſome ſpeech, or carriage of theirs, ſavouring of diſhonour to Father, or Mother, and this melteth their hearts kindly before the Lord, and maketh them ready to confeſs the ſame inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly to living Parents, as well as to the Lord, and that in all the aggravations thereof; yea when a very ſhadow of ſuch diſhonour of Parents, or the remembrance of any paſſages ſavouring thereof, though paſt long ago, and poſſibly before God touched their hearts effectually, as well as ſince that, theſe alſo are matters of heart Abaſings, breakings, and bitter complaints before the Lord: this argueth a good conſcience in this particular alſo. When they alſo do watch their ſpirits and hearts, to keep them to the Rule, as well as over <note place="margin">If watching over their ſpirits alſo ſo that end.</note> their ſpeeches, geſtures, and actions, to keep them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46944:33"/> as cloſe as may be to that rule, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother:</hi> this alſo argueth Honour of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">If there be no outward thing frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawing to it.</note> and Mother from a good conſcience. In a word, when there is no other thing of an inferiour nature, either to affright and force them to it, or on the other hand, to bribe them to it (as ſay ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, preferments, patrimony, or the like humane Attractives) and yet they are inwardly moved, and ſtrongly, and prevailingly carryed out, in a way of Honour of Parents: All theſe do undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly evince, that now at leaſt there is a bleſſed Spirit, and habit of Honour of Parents wrought in ſuch Children by the ſpeciall efficacy of the Holy Ghoſt, from which ſuch do now at leaſt Act, in matters reſpecting their Parents Honour, and that now at leaſt, a good conſcience, and conſcience to God and to his Command, doth ſet them about this bleſſed work.</p>
               <p>The clearing of this firſt mark, which indeed is the main of all, might ſatisfie us, but for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help in this diſcovery, let us adde three or four marks of Honour rightly given to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>A ſecond mark then hereof is, when Children <note place="margin">2. If holding up Parents Honour when aged, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed.</note> are conſcientiouſly carefull to hold up Parents Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, when they are Aged, yea, and when through infirmity, Parents ſome way miſcary. As <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> were cordially ſollicitous to hold up their Aged and miſcarrying Father <hi>Noahs</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; yea though tempted by their brother <hi>Chams</hi> deriſive tale about their Father, to have diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected him: yet ſee their conſcientious care of maintaining their reſpect, and reverence to their Father, in avoyding any occaſion (as ſight of his nakedneſs) which might have drawn on contempt of him, in them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>And</hi> Ham, <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                  <hi>of</hi> Canaan, <hi>ſaw his Fathers nakedneſs, and told his two brethren without,</hi> verſ. 23. <hi>And</hi> Shem, <hi>and</hi> Japhet <hi>took a garment, and laid it upon their ſhoulders, and went backwards, and covered the nakedneſs of their Father, and their faces were back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and they ſaw not their Fathers naked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When good Children do even thirſt after <note place="margin">3. If Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Parents ſouls welfare.</note> their carnall Parents ſouls welfare and peace, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, and are ever and anon contriving which way to help on that alſo. Thus did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> what in him lay, to help out his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Father <hi>Terah,</hi> from his courſe and way: as might be ſhewed by comparing <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 3, 4. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. end, and 12. 1. and <hi>John</hi> 24. 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When they are as willing and joyfull to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note place="margin">4.

               <p n="5">5. When they do not ſo ſoon forget their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents after they are dead and gone. <hi>Sarah</hi> was 90. years old, when ſhe bare <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 17. 17. And lived 37. years after. For ſhe died when ſhe was 127. years old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 1. then <hi>Iſaac</hi> was 37. years old: he was 40. years old, when he maried <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beckah,</hi> Gen. 25. 20. Which was three years after his Mothers death: and when he married, or took <hi>Rebeckah</hi> to wife, then it was that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted after his Mothers death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 67. For three years ſpace then, this pious Son was ever and anon mourning in thoughts of his good Mothers death, and God made this his ſweet companion

                  <hi>Rebeckah,</hi> a ſpeciall comfort to him againſt that trouble about his Mothers death.</p>
               <p>A third uſe is of exhortation: and that, to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <note place="margin">3. Uſe. Of exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1. To Parents to further this their due Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. 1.

               <p n="1">1. Take very ſpeciall care, to prevent whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, either may corrupt them, or any wayes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in the matter of the Honour of God himſelf, or of his word. For if they groſly fail in the matter of the Honour of God &amp; of his word, they will as groſly fail in the matter of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Parents; As we ſee in <hi>Elies</hi> Sons, who were vilely corrupt in the matters of Religion, as thoſe of common honeſty, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. they were as vile tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours againſt the fifth Commandement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Honour to Parents: they hearkened not to the voice of their Father.

Oh! that Chriſtian Parents would the rather keep out Anabaptiſtical principles and doctrines, as from their own hearts, ſo as much as may be from the eares and minds of their Children, leſt being told thereby, that they

He proved as very a perfidious and cruel wretch towards his own Father not many years after. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15. <hi>Rebeckah's</hi> care therefore was imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to prevent, or remove the continuall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and jarrs, and miſchiefs, which might ariſe from that heart-grudge between <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which becauſe ſhe could not heal, ſhe ſends away <hi>Jacob</hi> from <hi>Eſaus</hi> company, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 42, 43, 44, 45.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of Honour in ſpeciall due to Parents, and that in a direct way, and therein of Honour of reſpect and love due to Parents.</head>
               <p>HAving ſpoken of Honour in generall, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the 5. Commandement, from Children to Parents, we come now to ſpeak of Honour in ſpeciall due to them: &amp; firſt of that which is in a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46944:41"/> direct way: and therein according to the Method propounded in the firſt Chapter. 1. Of Honour of reſpect and love due to Parents; that Honour is ſo taken in Scripture we there gave Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, <note place="margin">That honour of reſpect to Parents is due, proved.</note> and need not now repeat them: we may then note as a branch of the general point, That Children are bound to Honour their Parents, with the Honour of choyceſt reſpect and love. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy Father and Mother,</hi> ſaith <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 12. But having them in choyceſt reſpect and love is Honouring of them, ſay other Scriptures, therfore Children muſt moſt highly reſpect and love their Parents. For our better handling of this branch of Honour, let us only ſhew wherein this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded reſpect and love to Parents doth conſiſt, or what is required of Children in this, that they are required ſo highly to reſpect and love their Parents, and then afterwards apply it by way of uſe.</p>
               <p>To the former we anſwer, that Children,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are to be delighted greatly in their <note place="margin">This reſpect conſiſteth 1. In delighting Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> Fathers preſence, to be much affected with the very ſight of a Father or Mother. See how <hi>Joſeph</hi> plotteth to have his Father near him, when he could not be ſo near his Father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt be near to me, &amp;c.</hi> And when he commeth to the ſight of his Father, after ſome years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced abſence of his from his Father, he's even overjoy'd (as we ſay) to ſee him: He is as one tranſported, for he falleth on his Fathers neck, having firſt humbly preſented himſelf to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 29. <hi>And he wept</hi> (for very extaſie of joy) <hi>on his neck a good while;</hi> his heart was ſo overcome with ſtrength of affections, that for a good ſpace he can ſilently weep, but not utter a word, that we read of till afterwards: till his good old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46944:42"/> firſt brake that deep ſilence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. and then <hi>Joſeph</hi> alſo ſpeaketh, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. As Children are to their Parents, the deſire of their eyes, and that whereupon they ſet their minds, their Sons and their Daughters, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 25. So ſhould Parents be to Children. <hi>Jacob</hi> had enough if his Son <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> be alive and well, he is content to die if God ſo pleaſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 30. Let the ſight of abſent, long abſent Parents, be to Children, even as dear and precious, and delighting, as their very lives, if not more: as it is in that precedentall love and reſpect of the genuine Children of the Father of Spirits; Oh the ſight of his face, the injoyment of his preſence, eſpecially after ſome ſpace of the want of his bleſſed preſence, what is it not to ſuch Childrens hearts? Such for the nature at leaſt of our reſpect and love, ſhould be Childrens love to their Parents.</p>

Both theſe paticulars are clear in inſtances, the former in <hi>Ruth,</hi> when her Siſter <hi>Orpha</hi> left her Mother with tears in her eyes, <hi>(Ruth</hi> 1. 14. <hi>And they lift up their voice and wept again, and</hi> Orpha <hi>kiſſed her Mother in Law,</hi> but) Ruth <hi>clave to her,</hi> yea, when urged by <hi>Naomi</hi> to return after her Siſter-in-Law, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:46944:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>then he will foolow Elijah:</hi> God will have the poore captive Woman, when her Maſter liketh her for his Wife, yet to bewaile her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a Moneth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 13. Such loathneſs God will have Children to expreſs to part with dear Parents, as Parents are wonderous loath to part with their Children, living or dying, unleſs urged by Gods Call: like good old <hi>Jacob</hi> firſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 38. <hi>My Son</hi> (ſaith he of <hi>Benjamin) ſhall not go down with you, for his Brother is dead, and he is left alone, if miſchief befall him by the way ye go, then ſhall ye bring down my gray haires with ſorrow to the grave,</hi> and <hi>Cap.</hi> 43. 22, &amp;c. <hi>And their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid, if it muſt needs be ſo, then do this,</hi> &amp;c. So ſhould Children not part with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, till they muſt needs, till God ſome way calleth them from them: as the genuine Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, ſuch is their love to him, that it is as death to part with him, though but for a time; Oh if it might be their Fathers pleaſure, they would never be from him, nor have him from them. So in the nature of our love to Parents, ſhould it be expreſſed to them; if God ſhould take them away from us, yet our love ſhould be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in our greateſt trouble and grief for them, as <hi>Iſaacks</hi> was to his Mother, for three years ſpace after, as was ſhewed from <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. compared with other Scriptures. When <hi>David</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his great grief for his very afflicted enemies, as if his friends or Brethren, I bowed down heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (ſaith he) as one that mourneth for his Mother, a Mother-Ieſs Childs mourning then, for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Mother, is the ſaddeſt of mournings; Hence it was of old a good Neighbourly Cuſtome, to give a conſolatory Cup, to ſuch as mourned for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother, as ſuch whoſe grief was deemed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46944:43"/> ſo great, that they needed ſome cheering; hence the contrary threatned in judgment, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, having his Father <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. newly deceaſed, and withall one young <hi>Prince,</hi> his own Son, dead alſo, he made light of his Sons death in compariſon of his Fathers, ſaying, He might come to have more Sons, but he ſhould never have any more Fathers, now this was gon. As for the other expreſſion of Childrens love to Parents, in longing after them, we ſee it in <hi>Jacob,</hi> witneſs that part of his plea, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 21. So that I come again to my Fathers houſe in peace, and <hi>Gen</hi> 31. 30. <hi>Laban</hi> took notice that <hi>Jacob</hi> long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſore after his Fathers houſe; as in that pattern of love of Gods Children, they ſhew in longing ſore after him, and of their Communion with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2, 3. and 62. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. So it is in Childrens love to their Parents: only, this longing after them, muſt not exceed the bounds of particular calls and callings or relations, as of Husbands, Wifes, Servants, Miniſters, Magiſtrates, &amp;c. But in ſuch a way and ſeaſon, as it may not break any other bonds of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Children are many waies to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <note place="margin">3. In denying themſelves for them</note> for their Parents choiſe good, any way, as when Children in their Parents wants or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, are called to be ſtaies to their Parents, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it might be more to their outward advantage to be elſe where, yet they muſt be willing to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and loſe ſomewhat with them, and for them, rather then forſake them in ſuch a caſe: as <hi>Ruth</hi> ſeeing her aged Mother-in-law, who had been full of outward bleſſings, but now is empty and very poor, ſhe will not leave her though a younger Woman and likely to do better for the outward man other where, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 1. 16, &amp;c. ſhe will work
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46944:43"/> hard for her, ſtoop low to become a poor glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to bring in ſupplies to her Mother-in-law, Cap. 2. and how long did <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the Managing their Fathers eſtate and outward affaires &amp; ſupplies? not alone before their Marriage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 35. but after, witneſs that <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 12, 14 &amp; 42. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 43. 15. and 47. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. Yea, Children are to be willing to run very great hazards or hardſhips, for their Parents ſakes, rather then to indanger them, in their perſons and names, or the like. Notable is that example of good <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, Gen.</hi> 44. 33, 34. having ſaid, v. 30. <hi>That his Fathers life was bound up in the Lads life,</hi> ſo that as v. 31. <hi>If he ſee not him return, he will die, and ſo they ſhal bring their Fathers gray haires with ſorrow to the grave; now therefore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Judah, let thy Servant abide inſtead of the Lad, bond-man to my Lord, and let the Lad go up with his Brethren, for how ſhall I go up to my Father, and the Lad be not with me? leſt paradventure, I ſee the evill that ſhall come to my Father; Judah</hi> had rather live and die a bond-man, if thereby he might lengthen out his Fathers daies, by <hi>Benjamins</hi> return, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his ſorrowfull end, by the detaining <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Memorable is that ſtory recorded by <hi>Pauſanias l.</hi> 10. writing of the <hi>Catanenſiaus,</hi> ſaith, that when <hi>Catana,</hi> a City bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Aetna,</hi> was ſet on fire by it, they made nothing of their Silver or Gold, but as they fled out, one taketh up his Mother upon his ſhoulders, another his Father, but becauſe they haſted not, being ſo loaden, the fire compaſſed them, the flame ſuddenly paſſing on, yet would they not lay down their Parents, wherefore they report, that the flames parted as in two, and paſſed over both the young men and their Parents, without mortall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46944:44"/> hurt of them, whence in his time, honourable memorials were aſſigned by them to the <hi>Catanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> God honoured thoſe acts of high reſpect to Parents, with a notable deliverance, and men ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured them with honourable monuments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And indeed, what did not the pattern of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial reſpect to his Father, the Son of God, hazard and undergo for his Fathers ſake and honour? and what will not any genuine Child of his, by his help under go, rather then hazard his name or cauſe, and there is a proportion of the like, in the Children of mens love to their Parents. Parents many waies denyed and hazarded themſelves for Children, and they may well do as much for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>

Abſolom</hi> would be feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a genuine filiall reſpect to his Father, in this particular, that his Fathers favour is all in all to him as a Son, and his life doth him no good, whileſt under his diſpleaſure, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 32. He would have <hi>Joab</hi> ſay on his behalf to the <hi>King his Father, wherefore am I come up from</hi> Geſhur? <hi>now therefore let me ſee the Kings face, and if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iniquity in me, let him kill me:</hi> but he was a

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of Honour of Reverence due from children to Parents.</head>
               <p>WE have handled that firſt branch of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Parents, in a direct way, we now proceed to the ſecond, which is the Honour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence: for ſo Honour is taken, as we ſhewed in the 1. Chapter. Obſerve then as a ſecond branch of the generall point, that,</p>
               <p>Children are to Honour their Parents with the Honour of Reverence, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 3. <hi>Ye ſhall fear</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Honour of Reverence due to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> 
                  <hi>every man his Mother and every man his Father,</hi> Heb. 12. 9. <hi>the Fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them due reverence.</hi> For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter handling of this part of Childrens duty, we ſhall firſt ſhew wherein this Reverence of Parents conſiſteth and is expreſſed, and 2. Make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt we ſay: this Reverence due to Parents, is either outward or inward.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then outward Reverence is due from chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">1. Outward, as</note> to Parents: and ſo, 1. Children are to riſe up and to ſtand bare before their Parents, when they come to them, or ſpeak to them: for if of Fathers in age, God ſaith, <hi>Riſe up before the hoary head, and Honour the face of the old man,</hi> Levit. 19. 31. <hi>[Riſing to Parents,]</hi> he ſurely requireth it of children to their own Parents: Henre the excuſe of <hi>Rachel,</hi> though a married woman, from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable neceſſity, as reaſon why ſhe roſe not up to her Father <hi>Laban,</hi> Gen. 31. 35. <hi>And</hi> Rachel <hi>ſaid to her Father, Let it not diſpleaſe my Lord, that</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:46944:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>I cannot riſe up before thee, for the cuſtome of women is upon me;</hi> it muſt be ſome avoidable neceſſity that muſt be a juſt reaſon that children riſe not up before their Parents, elſe Parents have juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be diſpleaſed, when <hi>Achsah</hi> daughter to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb,</hi> is to requeſt a thing of her Father, ſhe keepeth not her poſture of ſitting, in which ſhe was before, but lighteth off the beaſt ſhe rode upon, and then ſpeaketh her mind to her Father, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15. It ſtands not with Parents Honour, for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to ſit and ſpeak, but rather they ſhould ſtand up when they ſpeak to Parents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Parents be comming towards children, they <note place="margin">2. To meet parents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> are to prevent them, and meet them, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 19. Bathſheba <hi>went to</hi> Salomon, <hi>to ſpeak for</hi> Adonijah, <hi>and the King roſe up to meet her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They are to bow to them, ſo <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3.

               <p n="4">4. They muſt ſpeak Reverently both to their <note place="margin">4. To ſpeak to them and of them reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</note> Parents, and of them to others. To them: thence thoſe titles of Honour expreſſed in childrens ſpeeches to Parents: as in <hi>Rachels to Laban,</hi> Gen. 31. 35. <hi>let not my Lord be diſpleaſed:</hi> So in <hi>Iſaac's</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. 7. <hi>my Father,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>

So <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Come, let us return, leſt my Father leave caring for the Aſſes, and take thought for us.</hi> So <hi>Judah,</hi> Gen. 44. 34. <hi>how ſhall I go to my Father, and the Lad be not with me, leſt peradventure I ſee the evill that ſhall come upon my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. They are to fear to fall ſhort of their bleſſing, <note place="margin">6. To fall ſhort of their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> and benefit of parents prayers, and of their godly parentall wiſhes and Counſels; hence when <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> heard that his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> was ſo ſick, he made ſuch haſte to him, carrying his ſons with him, that he and they might not miſs of <hi>Jacobs</hi> bleſſing: even rude <hi>Eſau</hi> was amazed, when he heard that his Father had bleſſed his brother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46944:53"/> of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 34. hence that bitter cry, <hi>Bleſs me, even me alſo O my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. They are alſo to be inwardly, as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly <note place="margin">7. To be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly alſo aſhamed of faults before them.</note> aſhamed, that parents have juſt cauſe of diſtaſte againſt them at any time; ſo giving reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to parents, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. may according to the Greek word uſed there, be rendered, being <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed before them;</hi> hence the derivative from that verb is uſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 5. and 15. 34. to ſignifie <hi>ſhame</hi> inward and outward; as there, <hi>I ſpeak this</hi> to <hi>your ſhame;</hi> even of heart alſo. So here the Aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full childe, like that prodigall, occaſioning juſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte in his Father againſt him, he is inwardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of it, and therefore confeſſeth his ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Father, and unworthineſs to be called his Son. All which is clearly ſeen in the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall filial fear of Gods children to their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father: they inwardly fear his Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Fatherly Authority, his commands, reproofs, threats, and corrections, the loſs of his favour and incurring of his diſpleaſure, by their offending of him at any time: they are affraid to croſs his mind in any thing, or to grieve his Spirit themſelves, or that it ſhould be grieved by others, they are affraid to fall ſhort of his Fatherly bleſſing, and are inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſhamed, and even confounded that at any time they offend, diſpleaſe, grieve, or provoke him.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this branch of the point ſerveth, <note place="margin">Uſe 1. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof 1. Of childrens irreverence.</note> 1. For Reproof, 1. Of Children, for all that rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and irreverence of yours towards your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as if you had forgotten that you were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: or as if principles of piety, yea of morality, were extinct in you; And this alas how common an evill is it in children, even of profeſſours? how
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46944:54"/> rudely do they ſit before their parents, and how irreverently do they carry it, in their geſtures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them? how loud will too many be gabling laughing and flouting, even in their parents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? how forward are they to prevent or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their parents in ſpeaking, or to anſwer them again if rebuked by them? whereas thoſe in <hi>Job<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> time, even <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles, refrained talking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in his preſence, or whil'ſt he as a civill Father of the ſtate was ſpeaking, <hi>Job</hi> 29. 9, 10. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>after his words they ſpake not again. Elihu,</hi> when in the preſence of Fathers to him in Age, is affraid to ſpeak, much more to interrupt them whil'ſt ſpeaking, <hi>Job</hi> 32. 4, 6, 7. And dare children word it ſo before their parents? Again, how over-fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar do too many children make themſelves with their parents? as if hail-fellow well met (as they ſay) and no difference twixt parent and child; yea too many there are, who carry it proudly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully and ſcornfully towards parents, and its well if their very parents eſcape their flouts; but what the end of ſuch graceleſs children will be, we have ſhewed from <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 17. Again, how are many children ready to chop it with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and (as we ſay) to chop logick with them? it may be ſo daring are they as to bid their very parents hold their tongue, as ſome profaner ones have done; or how ever, if not going ſo high, yet giving to parents very croſs, curt, and curſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. As <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſons did ſometimes to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 31. <hi>ſhould he deal with our ſiſter, as with an Harlot?</hi> like the elder ſon in the Parable, who even chideth, and checketh his Father, for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his younger brother better then him, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 29. Again how frowardly and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly do many children carry it to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46944:54"/> no diet, no clothing, no lodging and the like, which parents can provide for them, will content them, but as if parents were beholding to them, or that they had wronged their children, and muſt ſeek to pleaſe them, if they knew how. Like the Elder ſon in the Parable, which findeth fault with his uſage by his Father, as ſo much below his ſerviceableneſs to him. And are there not too many children, who are ready to mutter and grumble at their parents counſels, commands, juſt threats, rebukes, or corrections? yea will not ſome plainly conteſt and contend with their parents? as <hi>Rebecka's</hi> daughters-in-Law; who by ſuch like unreverent carriages made her even weary of her life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 35. with 27. 46. they were <hi>a grief of mind</hi>

               <p>To the firſt I anſwer, that filial obedience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth,</p>

Look as Gods children, yea look as Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the pattern of all true filial obedience to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, refuſed not to ſtoop to the meaneſt offices and ſervices, in obedience to the Father of Spirits: ſo muſt children carry it in like ſort to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. All know how many mean and deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offices Parents do about their children, whileſt babes and little ones, and when ſick, &amp;c. And there is no cauſe for any childe to think much of the meaneſt office and ſervice, which Parents may call for from their hands. Parents Authority is of no mean deſcent, the riſe or originall of it is from God: even the greatneſs of the greateſt in other reſpects, doth not alter, much leſs make null, filial relations. <hi>If any be aſhamed of the Lords words, of him will he be aſhamed another day,</hi> Mark. 8. 38. Now this, <hi>Children obey your Parents in the Lord,</hi> (according to the Lords will and word) is one of the Lords words, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1.

               <p n="2">2. In Childrens being content to be croſſed in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46944:58"/> their own deſires or wayes, and to yeeld to and obey Parents minds and wils, in matters lawfull, although the particulars ſeem to be very harſh to their own ſenſe or reaſon, as in that inſtance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 17. At firſt it diſpleaſed <hi>Joſeph</hi> to ſee his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay his right hand upon <hi>Ephraims</hi> head, and he held up his Fathers hand to remove it to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes</hi> his head, and <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Joſeph ſaid, not ſo my Father, for this is the firſt born, put thy right hand upon his head,</hi> v. 19. <hi>And his Father refuſed, and ſaid: I know my Son, I know it, he alſo ſhall become great, but his brother ſhall be greater then he.</hi> And ſo he gave <hi>Ephraim</hi> the yonger Son the priority in his bleſſing; and <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid no more, but reſted ſatisfied therein. If <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons are injoyned by their Father to feed their flock even in <hi>Shechem,</hi> in the very mouth of danger, by reaſon of the late ſlaughter of the <hi>Shechemits</hi> by their hands, yet they are contented with it, and do not mutter, or object againſt it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 14. nor do they object againſt the hazzards of that long Journey into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but if required by their Father to go, they contentedly obey, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 23: It was contrary to dictates of fleſh, and blood, and reaſon, for <hi>Iſaac</hi> to yeeld to be offered up in Sacrifice by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but it was firſt no doubt made known to him by his Father to be Gods mind, and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Fathers command, and he quietly yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to his Father therein, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 9, 10. So in caſe of a daughters vow unto the Lord, in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is lawfull, and which ſhe earneſtly deſireth ſhould be done before the Lord, if the vow be not heard by her father when it was made, and after diſſallowed by her Father, God will have her, even in this caſe, to ſit down contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reſigning her will to her Fathers, although
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46944:59"/> ſhe cannot perform what ſhe vowed and deſired, and God himſelf paſſeth it by, becauſe it was not her Fathers mind, that ſhe ſhould perform it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 5. Gods children are a pattern to mens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren herein, who reſign and ſubmit their will to his will; children are to look at good Parents, as Gods Oracles unto them, ſuch, by means of whom he imparteth his counſell to them, and maketh wiſer then themſelves, in matters reſpecting their occaſions and changes. Obedience to Parents, in this way, is to be as to Superiours, yea as to the mind and Authority of the higheſt, in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates; which alſo is implied in that ſpeech, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Children obey Parents in the Lord,</hi> yea even <hi>in all things,</hi> as is expreſſed, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 20. namely which are meet and lawfull: ſo to obey them, it is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God, albeit in doing of it, children oft diſpleaſe themſelves. <hi>David</hi> is blamed, that he never diſpleaſed <hi>Adonijah</hi> his Son, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 5, 6. ſurely then <hi>Adonijah</hi> had been too blame, if he had not yeelded to his Fathers mind, in things diſpleaſing to himſelf.</p>

Parents lawfull and gracious commands obſerved by Children, are <hi>health to all their fleſh:</hi> and ſickly times often befall the yonger ſort, as here with us, where filiall obedience and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance is too much wanting: But I ſay beſides, that the Apoſtle inlargeth the benefit thereof in that expreſſion, <hi>that it may be well with thee,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not alone in matter of bodily health, but in that of name alſo, of eſtate, of family relations, of perſonall callings and occaſions, of generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as Chriſtians, and as members of the Church: yea alſo in thoſe ſpirituall matters of their ſouls in the things and comforts of God and of his word, and ſeals and ſervices, &amp;c. The way to have bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul to do well and proſper, yea the way to have God himſelf ſhining and ſmiling upon children, to have Gods bleſſing upon childrens reading, hearing and meditating of the word, to have God anſwering even their prayers, to have God ordering all things for good to them which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46944:62"/> befall them, to have God to be with them, and bleſs all they do take in hand, to do well by them in life and death; is to yeeld due and true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Parents. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 5. is verified in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiall hearkning to Parents counſels or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes: <hi>the eare that heareth reproof, abideth among the wiſe.</hi> It is amonſt the number of them, elſe that care or perſon would not hearken, but which is more, it abideth among them, ſuch an one doth not apoſtatize from the company and condition of perſons truly wiſe. I fear, if the bottom of the Apoſtaſie of many promiſing profeſſors now a daies were ſearched into, this would be found there, they were, or are diſobedient children to their parents, but as for the obedient, God is ſo well pleaſed with them, that he thinks he can never deal well enough with them.</p>

Or if you do any thing, which for the matter of it is injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by your Parents, yet formally and properly its not filial obedience, but rather yeelding obedience to ſome luſt of your own, which biddeth you do ſuch and ſuch things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Parents enjoyn. As when a covetous luſt will put you on to do your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will and work, that you may have the gain of it, or the like: or if you do at length what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents require in a better manner, yet it may abaſe you, that you did it not more readily, and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46944:62"/> you firſt were too diſobedient in your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, like the Son in the parable, that ſaid at firſt he would not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 28, 29. Afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he repented and went, and ſo at laſt did the will of his Father. But it was to him, and by proportion ſhould be to you, a ground of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhame and ſorrow, that at firſt you were ſo diſobedient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of ſuch children who are plainly diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note place="margin">2. Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> to your Parents, and perſiſt in it, or at leaſt continue too long in it, without repentance for the ſame. Some there are, that when their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents do even ſtoop ſomewhat below themſelves, and not command ſo much, as intreat them to do this or that lawfull thing at their requeſt, yet will boldly deny their parents deſires, like the Elder Son in the Parable, who when his Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out to him, and intreateth him to come in, will not come in, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 28, 29. Some when their Parents would have them of an honeſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or courſe of life, as more fit for that, and ſuch as may be more ſerviceable to God and men in it, yet will not be ruled, no they muſt take to ſome other courſe, that their fooliſh hearts like better, or elſe their Parents cannot be in quiet: like <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah,</hi> that contrary to God and his Father <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> mind, would needs be a King, when yet he was no way fitted for it, 1 <hi>King</hi> 1. Some will like thoſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2. be matching, but as themſelves only fooliſhly fanſie, and Parents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at reſt for them, but they muſt needs have ſuch a one, like <hi>Sampſon, Judg.</hi> 14. 2. He came and told his Father and Mother, ſaying, <hi>I have ſeen a woman in</hi> Timnath <hi>of the daughters of the Philiſtins, now therefore get her for me to wife:</hi> and when his Parents wiſely and faithfully replyed,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46944:63"/> 
                  <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Is there never a daughter among all my people, that thou goeſt to take a wife of the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Philiſtins? Sampſon</hi> ſaith to his Father, <hi>get her for me, for ſhe pleaſeth me,</hi> or, is right enough in mine eyes. Some children are grown to ſuch an height of diſobedience, as they are grown ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, reſolute &amp; wilful in their diſobedience, they are long habituated in it, they will not now be counſelled, commanded, reproved, or corrected by Parents; they are above that, they are paſt that, they will be no longer curbed, or controlled, not they, by Mother or Father either: but little do you conſider what a black brand you do carry herein, upon your ſelves, of your reprobation, and as a token thereof of your judiciall harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It was ſaid of <hi>Eſau, Eſau have I hated,</hi> (or in my counſell rejected) <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and what a grief of mind, was he to his Parents, by diſobedient carriage in his matches? <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46944:63"/> parents, or others, he hated their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, &amp;c. He is ſmitten by dreadfull horror of conſcience inwardly: whence that dolefull mourning at laſt, when it is too late, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. and with lothſome diſeaſes outwardly, he even rotteth above ground, and pineth away, his fleſh and body is conſumed: <hi>ibid.</hi> And hence we might give inſtances of very dreadfull exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the lives and deaths of ſtubborn and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient children: and what other can be expected when they are in that black rowl of perſons gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up of God to a reprobate mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>He gave them up to a mind void of judgement, to do thoſe things which are not convenient, being filled with all unrighteouſneſs,</hi> v. 29, &amp;c. <hi>diſobedient to parents,</hi> v. 30.</p>

It is more than all formalities of offering ſacrifices to him, or the like: as he ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 22. <hi>Behold, to obey is better then ſacrifice, and to harken then the fat of Ramms.</hi> As the contrary, <hi>diſobedience is as iniquity and Idolatry, verſe</hi> 23.

               <p>Now the better to further Children in giving this honour of filial obedience, we ſhall <note place="margin">Motives to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Parents.</note> propound 1. Some motives. 2. Some helps to it. As for motives thereunto, let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Lord himſelf doth highly honour ſuch as honour their parents, by honour of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">1. God and Men honour ſuch as yeeld it.</note> and he ordereth for them ſpeciall honour from others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>The inſtruction of a</hi>

                  <hi>Father, and the Law of a Mother harkened unto,</hi> (he ſaith) ſhall be <hi>an ornament to a Sons head, and as precious chaines about his neck,</hi> a badg and pledg of honour in the eyes of his people, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 18. He that hearkneth to reproof (of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent eſpecially) ſhall be honoured. Hence God cauſeth ſo honourable a Record to be kept, in Scripture, of the Acts of obedience to Parents, in <hi>Iſaac, Jacob, Joſeph,</hi> and others: Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35. 18, 19. Where God charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to tell the <hi>Rechabites, Becauſe you have obeyed the commandement of</hi> Jonadab <hi>your Father, and kept all his precepts, and done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that he hath commanded you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus ſaith the Lord, the God of Iſrael,</hi> Jonadab <hi>the Son of</hi> Rechab <hi>ſhall not want a man to ſtand before me for ever:</hi> namely ſo long as that ſtate and Church of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould ſtand, as they ſhould not he rooted out, (as <hi>Jer</hi> 31. 36. There is the like phraſe, in a like ſenſe) ſo they ſhould be be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably imployed, according to that phraſe in a like ſenſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 17, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Lord ſometimes taketh occaſion <note place="margin">2. God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth great things to ſuch in ſuch a way.</note> to manifeſt ſuch ſpeciall grace to children, whileſt in this way of filial obedience, as, either was not at all, or not in that meaſure ſhewed to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Obſervable is that in <hi>Jacob,</hi> whoſe journey to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> is put upon the account of his filial obedience, even by his malicious Brother <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau,</hi> Gen. 28. 7. now as he in his obediential way, journyed from <hi>Berſhebah</hi> towards <hi>Haran,</hi> v. 10, 11. there he ſeeth, the <hi>ladder ſet upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven, and behold, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God aſcending and deſcending upon it; and behold the Lord ſtood above it, and ſaid, I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>thy Father, the</hi>

Jacob <hi>awoke, and ſaid, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not, this is none other then the houſe of God, this is the gate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Never had <hi>Jacob,</hi> that we finde, before this time ſo glorious a manifeſtation of the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> to be God and man in one perſon, as that one Ladder with its top reaching to heaven, and its bottome on earth; to be as a bleſſed <hi>Medium</hi> and Mediator, by which God and Man, heaven and earth ſhould be joyned together, as by a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſet on earth, yet reaching up to heaven; to be he by whom the Angels miniſter unto us, and by whom all graces and ſpirituall bleſſings deſcend upon us, and our hearts and ſpirits, our prayers, praiſes, and other holy ſervices, yea, and our whole perſons one day, aſcend up to Heaven: Never had <hi>Jacob</hi> ſuch glorious promiſes of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon him and his ſeed before; Never was he in ſuch a Corner of Heaven before: And who then would not be incouraged to filial obedience, and to be found in the way there of, wherein o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have found more of God and Chriſt than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before?</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Gods ſpeciall preſence and bleſſing <note place="margin">3. Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preſence and bleſſing is with ſuch.</note> is with you in a way of filial obedience to your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: ſo in this Scripture mentioned, <hi>Jacob</hi> had Gods gracious promiſe of his preſence with him, and preſervation of him, in all places whither he

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That it tendeth to the ratification and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the promiſes made to you in your godly parents. As to <hi>Abrahams</hi> children in caſe of their obedience of his godly commands, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>I know</hi> Abraham, <hi>that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Children and houſehold after him:</hi> And they (in obedience to his command) ſhall keep <hi>the way of the Lord, that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham (even in his children after him) <hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him,</hi> even his promiſes reſpecting him and his ſeed. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 46. <hi>Set your hearts to all the words which I teſtifie among you this day, which you ſhall command your children to obſerve to do all the words of this Law,</hi> verſ. 47. <hi>For this is not a vain thing for you: becauſe it is your life, and through this thing you ſhall prolong your daies in the land which yee go to poſſeſs.</hi> Albeit God had made ſo many promiſes of their injoyment of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and many bleſſings of grace, protection, peace, and the plenty there upon them and their poſterity, yet the meanes of accompliſhment of all muſt be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That parents themſelves muſt ſet themſelves to obey all Gods Commands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They muſt lay their authority upon their Children, to require of them alſo obedience to all Gods Commands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Children, in obedience to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents commands, under God, they muſt obſerve to do all the words of that Law. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>David chargeth his Son</hi> Solomon <hi>ſaying, Keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in all his waies, &amp;c. that</hi> (by keeping this charge of God, as given in charge by me thy Father according to God) <hi>thou maieſt proſper in all thou doeſt,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:46944:69"/> 
                  <hi>the Lord may confirm his word which he ſpake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me,</hi> (namely in reſpect to my Children) ſaying, <hi>If thy Children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and ſoul, there ſhall not fail thee, ſaid he, a man on the throne of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That your examples of filial obedience, in <note place="margin">5. It will be a meanes of the like obedience in other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> you, may be a meanes to work ſomewhat, at leaſt, upon other Children, yea, even upon diſobedient ones, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> did upon <hi>Eſau,</hi> Gen. 28. 6, 7, 8. He never conſidered his diſobedient courſe of match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Canaanites</hi> againſt his parents minde: <hi>But when he ſaw that</hi> Iſaac <hi>his father had bleſſed</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, <hi>and ſent him away to Padan Aram, to take him a Wife from thence,</hi> and not to take a Wife of the Daughters of <hi>Canaan, and that</hi> Jacob <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Father and Mother, and was gone to Padan Aram, and</hi> Eſau <hi>ſeeing the Daughters of Canaan pleaſed not</hi> Iſaack <hi>his father,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>Then went</hi> Eſau <hi>to</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>and took</hi> Mahalath <hi>the daughter of</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>Abrahams Son to wife;</hi> Now he thought his matching thus unto the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> might better pleaſe his Father, and ſo did it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In that elſe, in a contrary way of diſhonour <note place="margin">6. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will expoſe the very place where they are to Gods curſe.</note> of parents, you will, what in you lieth, expoſe the very place where you are to Gods curſe. Hence that of <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 6. It is propheſied, that by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and bleſſing of God in <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, parents hearts which were ever alienated from their ſtubborn and wicked children, and theirs as much from their good parents, not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be at their Beck, the Children ſhall be ſo effectually changed to holy obedience to God, and them according to God, that the Children ſhall win parents hearts, and the parents ſhall have their Childrens hearts (leſt otherwiſe) <hi>I come,</hi> ſaith God,

                  <hi>and ſmite the earth with a curſe:</hi> And oh that all Children would conſider this, &amp; become obedient according to God, leſt otherwiſe God be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to blaſt and cruſh the very place where they are, as he is wont to blaſt that very place and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where diſhonour and diſobedience to parents becommeth the common and prevailing ſin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Now for the helps unto honour of filial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">Helps to it.</note> they are ſuch as theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of ſuch things as hinder filial o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and breed and feed ſtubborneſſe in you <note place="margin">1.

Chapter, in the helps there propoſed to further Children in giving that honour in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall which is due to parents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Labour to ſee the evils of your former diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient <note place="margin">2.

               <p n="3">3. Make an holy and fruitfull improvement <note place="margin">3.

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of Honour of Recompence or thankefulneſs due to Parents.</head>
               <p>WE have handled three branches and parts of direct honour of parents injoyned in the fifth Commandement: namely honour of reſpect, of reverence, and of obedience. We come now to the fourth, and that is honour of Recompence, for ſo honour is taken in Scripture language, for honour of recompence, as was ſhewed in the firſt Chapter. Obſerve then as a fourth branch of the poynt in generall; that children are to honour their parents with the honour of thankfulneſſe or <note place="margin">Honour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to be given to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, proved.</note> thankful recompence. Chriſt himſelf ratifieth this as commanded of God, and as injoyned alſo virtually in the fifth Commandement, and that if a Son do nothing for his Father and his Mother in their need, they break that Commandement, and ſuch as are—inſtruments to hinder them from it, they make the word of God of none effect, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Moſes ſaid, honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> verſ. 12. <hi>and ye ſuffer a man no more to do ought for his Father or Mother,</hi> verſ. 13. <hi>making</hi>

                  <hi>the word of God of none effect,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 4. <hi>But if any Widdow have Children, or Nephewes, let them,</hi> that is the Adult Children of ſuch ancient wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, <hi>learn to ſhew piety;</hi> (or kindneſſe) <hi>at home, and to requite their parents:</hi> that this is the meaning, is evident from the ſcope of the Apoſtle, who is ſpeaking of what Widdowes are to be honoured and owned by the Church, imployed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Church, <hi>viz. ſuch as are Widdowes indeed,</hi> verſ. 3. namely as <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. expoundeth, every way deſolate, not only in reſpect of want, or deprivall of an husband to provide for her, but of Children or near kindred to take care of her, or miniſter ſupply to her. As for any other Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. expreſſeth, who hath Children or Nephewes to provide for her, the Apoſtle would not have the Church charged with them, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth it from God as the Childrens duty (if ſuch be living) or near kinsfolkes duty, to ſhew piety or kindneſs to them, and eſpecially the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they muſt learn to ſhew piety to them at home, and to requite their parents. And its obſervable, that the Holy Ghoſt ſaith not, let them only ſhew piety &amp; requite Parents, but let them learn to do it: there is an holy skill and art of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, to know wherein, and how, and when, and for what ends to do it: every one knoweth not the right art of doing it. And he that hath any holy skill that way, may be a daily proficient in it, there is ſome myſtery in it, and it would be learned by all: every one muſt be teachable, and willing, and deſirous to underſtand his duty this way, and to know it more and more: and the more each one practiſeth, according to the Rules of God, this commendable art, the better artiſt, no doubt, he will prove therein.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:46944:72"/>
               <p> I ſhall endevour, according to that ſmall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which I have received, to give ſome few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, which may be of ſome uſe this way.</p>
               <p>Let us then firſt conſider wherein, or in what way this filial gratefull recompence is to be made to Parents.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Make ſuch uſe of it, as may both diſcover any thing contrary to it, or any hinderance in it: and likewiſe what may any way further either the Theorie or Practice of it. In all which we ſhall make much uſe of that fundamentall notion (as I may call it) which the Holy Ghoſt giveth us for this end, in the very phraſe he uſeth to expreſs the duty it ſelf, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp; vicem rependere,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> and others render it, <hi>parentibus;</hi> or to progenitours, as it is in the Greek: whether next parents, or Grand-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Grand-Mothers, or the like: there muſt be a thankful retaliation, as much as may be, though perfectly and fully it cannot be; for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have given their children their beings (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God,) and their very life and exiſtence: which the children can never do to them; but as much as may be they muſt repay them like for like. Touching the firſt thing propounded, in what way children muſt recompence parents; I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In way of gratefull ſerving of them, and <note place="margin">It conſiſteth in childrens 1. Gratefull ſerving of their parents.</note> their good, as thereunto called of God: <hi>Paul</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth to this in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>for as a Son with the Father hath he ſerved with me in the Goſpell,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. <hi>his Son that ſerveth him.</hi> In caſe eſpecially of parents meanneſs, (as with us generally in <hi>New England)</hi> there is need, that ſome of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at leaſt ſhould even work for them. Jeſus Chriſt, when on earth, he wrought hard with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46944:72"/> his reputed Father, for the maintenance of his poor Mother, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Is not this the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the Son of Mary?</hi> And I ſay, in way of grateful ſerving of parents, they muſt do that in a way of gratitude, which their parents, in way of parentall love, did for them; they muſt <hi>vicem reddere,</hi> (as I ſaid the phraſe is in <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4.) give like for like. How did parents work and labour <note place="margin">Working for them out of love to them.</note> for them? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They did it with much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſpect and affection to children, for love of them rather than themſelves; they had many a bowel-pang, and thought of their children, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them on to, and in their toyles and labours. Alas, thought they, many and many a time, if we take not ſuch and ſuch pains, if we uſe not ſuch and ſuch diligence in our callings, our poor help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs babes, our poor children will want this and that for the back, and for the belly, &amp;c. As <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 30. <hi>when ſhall I be for mine own houſe alſo?</hi> He looketh not ſo much to provide for himſelf, as for his wives as an husband, for his children as a Father: children do you like for like. If ſervants in ſome caſes will continue ſerving their Maſters, becauſe they love them, whence that boring of ſuch a ſervants ear, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 5, 6. then do you children much more, out of reſpect to your parents: this ſerving of parents, and labouring for them, and that out of reſpect to them, is all but due debt on your part. You have reaſon to look backward to what is paſt, and lyeth already in banck on your parents part, and what Bils or Bonds on their part, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir greater disburſments this way than ever you can make, if you ſhould ſerve them all your daies. And if you pay in now a little, and then a little, as you are able, and as your parents needs call for it,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46944:73"/> yet may you very well have low thoughts of all ſuch petty payments, as yet are ſo exceedingly ſhort of that vaſt ſum of ſervice, and miniſtration, which is due to your parents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Parents did what ſervice of love they did for their children, with a great deal of Alacrity <note place="margin">With alacrity.</note> and freeneſs, with heart and good will (as we uſe to ſay) Children, do you the like for them; even ſervants are to ſerve their Maſters with <hi>good will,</hi> Eph. 6. 7. and to do what they do for them, <hi>ex a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo,</hi> heartily, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 23. Much more ſhould chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do ſo, in what you do for your parents. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents [good hearts!] they did nothing they did for children, grudgingly, though never ſo harſh to fleſh and blood, though very toilſome, no, it never deared them (as we ſay) knowing that their poor children ſhould have the benefit of it, more wayes than one. Oh that children would think of it, and do like ſervice of love for them; then would there never be ſuch grumbling with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as there is with too many, as if every thing were too much, or too harſh, which they are put to do for ſupply of parents wants. Parents never needed urging, or forcing, no nor their childrens calling upon them, to be doing for them and their good; let children do like for like: let none, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or others, need to urge you with many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, or compel you by blowes or mulcts, to be doing this compenſatory ſervice, but let it be as a very naturall fruit, ariſing freely, from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate principle and root within. Parents needed no eye of man, of their children, or of others, to look after them, and ſee that they were diligent in their ſervice of love for their children, no, when none were by, as well as when any were preſent, ſtill they plied it hard for the ſupply of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46944:73"/> wants, for their childrens welfare: let chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do like for like; very ſervants to Maſters, ſhould not do <hi>eye ſervice,</hi> Col. 3. 22. and it would be a ſhamefull and loathſome thing moſt of all in children, to do eye ſervice for parents.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Parents were conſtant, and unwearied, in <note place="margin">Conſtantly and unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly.</note> their labours, for their childrens good; they thought nothing they did, or could do, too much, or ſcarce enough, for their childrens good; Oh that children would but give like for like to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents! then would there never be ſuch counting upon ſo much, and ſo much, which children have done for parents; Many a poor honeſt parent hath even worn out themſelves, and waſted and exhauſted their very ſtrength, in their ſervice of love for their children; and it would be a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous thing, if children ſhould not now do all that ever they can to maintain theſe their decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, decrepit, exhauſted parents; I had almoſt ſaid ſervants.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Parents in their ſervice of love, on behalf of their children, condeſcended to meaneſt offices, and imployments, ſuch indeed they were, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when their children were little, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, or many wayes bodily diſtempered and ill at eaſe, that none elſe but tender hearted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Fathers and Mothers, would have done for them; let children do like for like for parents, as they may have uſe, or ſtand in need of them. As in the parable (oft made uſe of in this diſcourſe) the Son, when come to rights, he was willing to be as his Fathers ſervant, yea the meaneſt of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as his <hi>hired ſervant,</hi> Luke 15. 17, 18, 19. <note place="margin">2. In being a comfort to them in their ſorrows and ſufferings.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond way of ſuch grateful recompencing of parents, is, by being a comfort to them againſt their ſorrows, and ſufferings. As when parents
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46944:74"/> meet with any ſad loſſes, croſſes, reproaches, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions for Chriſts ſake, when exiled, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or the like; let children cheer them up all they can, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 29. <hi>Lamech</hi> called his Sons name <hi>Noah, ſaying, this Son ſhall comfort us, concerning our work, and toil of our hands, becauſe of the ground which the Lord hath curſed.</hi> Let children be as ſo many <hi>Noahs,</hi> comforts, and comforters, againſt whatſoever miſeries, or calamities which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall their parents, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 15. this ſhall be <hi>a reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of thy life, and a nouriſher of thy old age;</hi> the grand-child <hi>Boaz,</hi> muſt be his grand-mothers cheriſher, ſuccourer, and ſupporter, under God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all her faintings, ſinkings, and troubles of her elder times; when that ſad news of <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſuppoſed death came to <hi>Jacobs</hi> eares, All his Sons and daughters roſe up to comfort him; Children are branches of their Parents, as of a Vine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128. 3. <hi>(thy wife ſhall be as the fruitfull Vine by thy houſe ſide)</hi> whoſe branches yeeld ſuch grapes, ſuch fruit, from which choyceſt wine is made, whereby mans heart is cheared, quickned and inlarged: let children then yeeld ſuch chearing, quickening, ſtrengthning and inlarging fruit to their parents, when ſad, when their Spirits are ready to fail, and ſink within them, through troubles inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. As other wine, or fruit of the Vine, is for thoſe that are of a heavy heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 6. So children, as children, as receiving a being from their parents, as of the Vine of which they came, are to yeeld comforting fruit, eſpecially to their ſorrowfull parents; children ſhould carry it ſo, and be ſuch to ſad and ſuffering parents, as they may make up many other loſſes, and croſſes, to them. As it was ſaid of <hi>Ruth</hi> (whoſe ſtory is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, occaſionally, made uſe of, in this diſcourſe)
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46944:74"/> 
                  <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 15. <hi>for thy daughter-in-Law, which loveth thee, which is more to thee than ſeven Sons, hath born him. Naomi</hi> had loſt her two dear Sons, yea but <hi>Ruth</hi> is ſuch a ſuccourer, and ſupporter, and comforter to her, that ſhe is inſtead of many Sons that way to her. <hi>Eve</hi> loſeth her hopefull Son <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> and her wound is the greater, in that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cain</hi> murthered him; yea but <hi>Seth</hi> is given her, as one appointed of God to be <hi>another ſeed</hi> to her, <hi>inſtead of</hi> Abel, <hi>whom his brother</hi> Cain <hi>ſlew,</hi> Gen. 4. 25. ſhe looketh for all that good and comfort from him, which <hi>Abel</hi> might have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to her; and ſo doubtleſs ſhe found it made good to her; children, in this alſo, muſt <hi>vicem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendere,</hi> pay and give in like for like. Ah the bowels of parents towards children! when any evill, or calamity befalleth them, when any way ill at eaſe, when ſad through-outward, or inward troubles, or preſſures, they put their ſouls in their ſouls ſtead, they would not ſuffer them to lie grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and waſting themſelves with grief, if with all their wiſdom, and grace and ability they had, inward, or outward, they could redreſs the ſame: when their children were litle, ſuch comforts, and cordials were parents unto them, and when their children are adult, they were the ſame to them: let children then repay like for like to their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved afflicted parents; If to him that is melting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with trouble (as that Hebrew word in <hi>Job</hi> 6. 14. ſignifieth) ſuch expreſſions of ſympathy ſhould be ſhewed from a friend to his friend, much more from a child to a parent; if a brother be <hi>born for adverſity,</hi> Prov. 17. 17. Is it not one end of a childs being born from his parents, to be a help, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to them in adverſity? Children ſhould be as eyes to their dim-ſighted parents, as ſtrength to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46944:75"/> them when weak, Feet to them when lame, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhers to them when in need of meat and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſweet melody to them to make their very hearts dance within them, and a very flaffe to their age, as it is ſaid, that <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> was unto his Father. If Chriſt himſelf account ſo of each of his Diſciples, who do the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be his Brother, Siſter, and Mother, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the faithfull reſpects and ſervice of the love of ſuch to him-ward, but in reſpect of his own reſpects and ſervices of love, ſuccour, and ſympathy towards them, as of a child towards a Mother, and of a Brother or Siſter towards a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Siſter, eſpecially when afflicted, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 9. and <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 35. It will be a Chriſt-like part, and an Image of his indeared, and ſelf-denying reſpects to us, who have done to him any ſervices, and offices of love, that gracious children, be as children indeed, in way of holy recompences, by all due reſpects, ſuccour and ſympathy of love, to their afflicted Mothers or Fathers, for all thoſe greater ſervices, ſuccours, and ſympathies of their love towards them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let children recompence parents by being <note place="margin">3.

Oh the many ſollicitous thoughts, and moſt ſerious endeavours of parents, about their childrens ſafety, and outward good, when time was! when they were but in any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-hood of any harm come to them, when they were little, if they were but miſſing a while from

So have dear parents many a time done the like for their children; if looking but a little more pale than uſual, or not eating their meat, as at other times, Ah the fears, and heart-akes of tender-hearted parents about them, leſt they ſhould fall ſick: or if any way hurt, or in pain, or ſick, Oh the ſorrowful dayes and nights, which parents that while paſs over, fearing leſt they ſhould miſcarry, and how many caſtings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and contrivings, and inquiries are made by parents, what way, or courſe, or means might be ſeaſonably uſed, which is moſt likely to eaſe, or heal, or revive their dear children, and to reſcue them from the Jawes of death; let children repay unto parents like for like. How many haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, how many ſufferings, have parents formerly expoſed themſelves unto, for childrens good and ſafety? Like <hi>Moſes</hi> his parents, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 23. through faith hiding <hi>Moſes,</hi> when an infant, from the miſchief of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butchery, not fearing the Tyrants bloody edict, which was, that each male child of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould be ſlain; or like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who underſtanding that wife and children, and all are captived by the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> he will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture a thouſand hazzards, but he will reſcue them. Many a tender-hearted Mother will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her ſelf to be ſome way miſchiefed, by a bear, or bull, or dog, or the like, to ſave and reſcue her child from being hurt by any of them, when they are in imminent danger thereof; She will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to thruſt her tender hand into the very fire, to pull or ſnatch out her little child, from being burnt or ſcorched by it. Now let children repay them like for like.</p>

In all their bodily ayles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, their perſons and eſtates were ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to them; yea ſometimes when through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity they were froward, and diſtempered in their ſpirits; let children do the like for parents; let them provide for their own parents eſpecially, what is meet for them in all reſpects. Parents did ſeaſonably provide all needfull ſupplies for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and did not procraſtinate, but took the firſt opportunity to do it for them; let children do as much for parents, when they need their help and ſupply.

Parents, in many reſpects, denyed themſelves, for their childrens ſakes: fared the harder, that they might have food enough, ſometimes ſpared it from their own bellies, that their children might have it; they went meanly and coarſely clad, that the children might have the better apparel; eſpecially thoſe little children that were more ſhiftleſs that

It was not coſt their parents ſtood upon, according to their abilities and ranck, they would willingly ſequeſter of the beſt of their eſtates, ſo their children might have what was fit for them, for back, or belly, for their education to literature, or other imployments as they were thereof more capable, let children repay like for like in this, to ſpare no coſt for them: and to let parents partake of the beſt of what God giveth them, and not of the refuſe thereof, for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. It was an ingenious Act of <hi>Reuben,</hi> who finding a thing better than ordinary, a Mandrake, he bringeth and giveth it to his Mother <hi>Leah,</hi> Gen. 30. 14.

And when he commeth to <hi>Egypt,</hi> he doth not put him into ſome waſt building, or into ſome blind and old hole, and barren out-corner of the Land, but he procureth him and his houſhold to be placed in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> in the beſt part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 45. 13. compared with Chap. 47. 6. And what though children ſhould be fain to ſpare ſomewhat from themſelves, for ſuch like needfull ſupplies of their parents, out of their beſt things? yet they muſt do like for like, their parents having done as much and more for them, as we ſaid even now.

And how juſtly all this is due, from children to parents, its not a matter left to their own curteſie, and will, whether they will do it, or not do it; nor is it a matter of meer charity, as alms to other poor, but children are bound thereto, as debtors; and no wonder, he ſaith its meeter we provide for the cauſes of our being, than for our ſelves; For he maketh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (and that rightly) parents debtors, (as he doth elſe-where in his Ethicks) and debtors we know, muſt, in caſe, take care to pay their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, and to Live of the reſt; as the Prophet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.

               <p>Do you what lieth in you, to further, and look <note place="margin">1. To parents to further this gratitude in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 1.

               <p n="1">1.

Thus God required of them of old, that they ſhould ſo carry it, that they might <hi>leave the Land of</hi> Canaan, (a Type of bleſſings of an higher nature) <hi>for an inheritance to their Children for ever.</hi> The like is charged; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 8. This was the gratious care of the Fathers of the two tribes and half, to detain their children in the way of Gods worſhip and fear, and to prevent whatſoever might hinder or diſcourage their poſterity from the ſame, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22. 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, ſaying, in time to come your children might ſpeak to our Children, ſaying, what have you to do with the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>yee have no part in the Lord; So ſhall your Children make our Children ceaſe from fearing the Lord.

Thus <hi>Jacobs</hi> care was <hi>to provide for his houſe,</hi> Gen. 30. 30. and he had children ſolicitous and induſtrious to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for him, in his ſtraits, in that time of famine, witneſs, their journeyes for that end into <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 42. and 43, and 44.

               <p n="3">3.

Thus it was in <hi>Joſephs</hi> caſe, he thought that God made him a Lord in all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to preſerve his Father, and his houſhold alive, in that time of famine, and upon that ground ſends to him to come to him, promiſing to nouriſh him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. and accordingly he did it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 12. <hi>And Joſeph nouriſhed his Father, and his brethren, and all his Fathers houſhold, with bread, according to their Families.</hi> To conclude this with that memorable ſpeech of <hi>Cyrus</hi> mentioned by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Apothegms; he uſed to ſay (and that which is the truth) <hi>he is not fit to rule over others, who is not profitable to his parents.</hi>

               <p>HAving diſpatched the direct Acts and wayes of Honour of parents, we come now to that Honour of Parents, which is due to them in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect way. For ſo honouring another is taken in Scripture, for being ſuch, or carrying it ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, whom men are to Honour, as it may make for ſuch an ones Honour: as we ſhewed in the 1. Chapter. So here in the 5th Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement this indefinite word, <hi>Honour thy Father, &amp; thy Mother,</hi> taketh in Honouring of parents in a reflect way, and bindeth Children to be ſuch to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46944:90"/> their parents, and to carry it ſo, as may redound to their Honour, eſpecially being ſuch parents as the covenant Jewes were, in Church State, and many of them godly, to whom this Law of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Commandement, was firſt ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged, and to whom it was more ſolemnly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.—Whence note, That its the duty of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <note place="margin">Children of good Parents, eſpecially bound to be ſuch, and to carry it ſo, as maketh for their Parents Honour, and that, 1.

Now here alſo let us ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How this is to be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why it muſt be ſo.</p>
               <p>And 3. Apply and make uſe of this ſo weighty a point. Concerning the firſt, ſuch children eſpecially are bound,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be obſerving, minding, priſing, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring up ſuch parents good ſpeeches, as ſo many oracles of God: which will evidence to all, that their Children honour them; <hi>Job</hi> 15. 18. <hi>which wiſe men have told from their Fathers, and have not hid it;</hi> a ſign then, that thoſe wiſe Children, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded well, and ſtored up their godly Fathers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 1, 2. <hi>We have heard with our ears, Oh God, our Fathers have told us, what thou didſt in their dayes,</hi> &amp;c.

This reflecteth much Honour upon parents wiſdome and ability, that they are able to give forth Gods mind to their children; and upon their piety and fidelity, that they make conſcience to do it; and upon their holy induſtry and vigilancy, that they are ready to take all occaſions to help on their Children in the things of God.</p>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46944:123"/> ſhould be brought into the field, not into the Markets that they ſhould ſpend their firſt year not in Lxury, but in work and Labours; And the <hi>Spartans</hi> had another Law, that if any of their Free-men neglected the diſcipline of youth, he ſhould be diſenffranched; <hi>Aelian</hi> alſo ſpeaketh of another ſore puniſhment which the conquering <hi>Mytileneſians</hi> impoſed upon their revolting aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, that their Children ſhould not be trained up to the liberall Sciences; <hi>Plato</hi> was wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this as a groſſe evill in thoſe of his times, that men would beſtow all their care and paines in getting Riches, but took little, or no care about their Children, unto whom they were to leave their Riches. When one anſwered <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> that for a thouſand drachmes which he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bring up his Son to Learning, that he could buy a ſervant; nay, ſaith the Philoſopher, you ſhall have two ſervants, to wit, him that you buy, and your own Son too. <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſometime ſaid, he had rather be a Ram or ſheep of a <hi>Megarenſian,</hi> than his Son, whereby he declared, that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garenſes</hi> took more diligent care of their Cattel, than of their Children. To conclude with one admonitory Item to ſome in theſe daies, who are ſecret enemies to catechizing Children, and bringing them up in Learning, Let them tremble to think with how like a ſpirit they are acted to that of that notorious Apoſtate <hi>Julian,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the extirpation of the Chriſtian Religion, thought no way better, than to put down cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing and Schooles of Learning: as for other Parents who would full gladly bring up ſome of their Sones, who have naturall partes for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but through Idleneſſe or Voluptuouſneſſe, or
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46944:123"/> the like, they will not be drawn to attend it, or to be trained up to it, let then ſome other way pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, with ſuitable epreſſions of Parentall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſt and diſpleaſure. <hi>Solons</hi> law this way, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too harſh, that if Sons would not be drawn by their Parents to Learning, their Parents ſhould deny them neceſſaries; but yet Chriſtian Parents would do ſomewhat this way, that ſuch Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould know themſelves, and ſufficiently ſee cauſe to bewail their folly and errour. I have been long in this firſt way of Parents furthering Children in being an honour to them, becauſe it is of great moment; we ſhall be briefer in the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then let Chriſtian Parents, as a help to the ſaid end, be ſure to leave your Children under <note place="margin">2.

The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would not leave one of their Children in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 10. 9, 10. Where God pure Religion was not, nay, where ſacrifices to the Lord was an abomination, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 27. and where the government of the ſtate was tyrannicall; theſe better-minded people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> when the godly Prieſts were put down by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> and removed to <hi>Judah,</hi> under <hi>Rehoboham,</hi> and when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſet up corrupt unworthy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to be prieſts, they alſo removed themſelves and families to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 13, 14, 15, 16. Hence that enquiry of the company of the godly, <hi>Canticles</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my Soul loveth, where thou dwelleſt, and where thou cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt thy flock to reſt at noon?</hi> that parching time of enemies raging againſt the truth, waies, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, to which Chriſts anſwers, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Go</hi>

They have caſt me out this day from the Lords inheritance, (where his ordinances and Miniſters and people are) ſaying, Go and ſerve other Gods—their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in driving me out amongſt ſtrangers to Gods pure Religion and Lawes, do even as it were ſay, Go, and ſerve other gods, putting me upon that temptation to it. But by leaving our Children under good ordinances and goverment, we do hereby greatly further them in the beſt things, and thereby alſo in becomming an honour to us.</p>
               <p>For 1. They are furthered that way by your godly Miniſters there; and the pure diſpenſation of the word and ordinances by them; when ſuch Fiſhers are upon the Churches banks, your fiſh of all hand great and ſmall are wont to be caught and drawn to the Land, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 8, 9, 10. by <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Miniſtry (as we before ſhewed) all is brought to rights 'twixt Children and Parents, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>He ſhall turn the hearts of the fathers to the Children, and the hearts of the Children to the father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They are much helped that way by the Churches and Saints Chriſtian watch over them, Counſels, inſtructions, and ſeaſonable admonitions of them, and prayers for them. <hi>Peter,</hi> as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, having all virtuall, Apoſtollical, and Church

The Children of the Church have a beneficiall privilege, that they muſt be watched over, kept from wanderings, ſearched out if ſtarted aſide, and brought in if gone aſtray, healed if diſeaſed, cheriſhed and nouriſhed up by all holy meanes, of which they are capable, kept to their paſturage, watering, folding, and the like.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

For which end, let me briefly propound, 1. Some motives.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some helpes.</p>
               <p>The Motives to it may be ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that ſuch good intereſt of Children, and ſuch godly precepts and examples of Parents, which are layed before them, they are a ſpecial talent of mercy, and therefore God expects that you ſhould make an honourable inprovement of them; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh of the ſame thus, as his mercifull advantage, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>For I was my Fathers Son,</hi> verſ. 4. <hi>He taught me alſo,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>Hear O my Son, and receive my inſtruction, and the yeares of thy life ſhall be many,</hi> and ſo be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour every way of Parents, as a meanes to that end, and then addeth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>I have taught thee in the way of wiſdome,</hi> (namely, inſtructively) <hi>I have led thee in the right paths,</hi> (namely, exemplari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;) the like holy advantage did they make of that counſel and doctrine of their Fathers, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 144. 1. and <hi>David</hi> likewiſe maketh advantage of his Mothers intereſt in God, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 86. 16. and <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 116. 18. Now if this be a talent, it muſt be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for one day, and Children had need look that they make anſwerable returnes. Parentall nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and admonition, and Chriſtian education is an holy advantage to ſuch Children, above others that want the ſame, As being Gods ordinance
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46944:126"/> for Childrens beſt welfare, as was ſhewed before. When <hi>Solomon</hi> had charged his Son to <hi>keep his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers command,</hi> and not to <hi>forſake the Law of his Mother,</hi> Prov. 6. 20. verſe 23. he addeth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>for the commandement</hi> (even of a godly Father) <hi>is a lamp, and the Law</hi> (even of a godly Mother) <hi>is light, and reproofs of inſtruction</hi> (given by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents alſo to Children) <hi>are the way of life, Prov.</hi> 29. 11. <hi>The rod and reproof give wiſdome:</hi> namely, as Gods appointed means, in the uſe whereof he will give it to Children. Godly examples are alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forcible and helpfull, hence the godly are ſaid to be bleſſings in all places where they are caſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19. 2. As Husbands may be wonne to God &amp; good, <hi>while they behold the Godly and wiſe converſation of their wives,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 1. So may a child by the gracious example of godly Parents; yea, ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have the ſuperadded advantage of their good Parents, and Anceſtours Covenant intereſt, Prayers and bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 26. <hi>The bleſſings of thy Father,</hi> (ſaith, <hi>Jacob</hi> to his Son <hi>Joſeph) have prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the bleſſings of my Progenitors,</hi> every godly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtour and Parent, contributeth ſomething to the Childs bleſſed ſtock, beſides the bleſſed advantage which ſuch Children have to be an Honour to God, and to their Parents, by the very Entail of grace by Promiſe and Covenant of God, from their Parents unto them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>The Lord will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed—to love him, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. The word and ſpirit in the mouth of the Anceſtours, is promiſed to the ſuceeding Children, let Children then of the Church of the godly, look you husband this holy advantage the rather to Gods and godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Honour.</p>

In that the poſterity of Papiſts, and Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, will follow the tract of their parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and examples, and will by no means depart therefrom; and ſhall not ſuch children as you are, much rather follow your godly teaching and leading Parents, without departing from their bleſſed counſels and examples? God forbid any ſhould do otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that otherwiſe if you will not do thus to the honour of your godly parents, verily then, all the bleſſed words which your good parents have urged, and charged, and that as from God, by their parentall authority, upon you their children, they will come in, another day, as evidences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, according to that phraſe concerning Gods word delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and by them to be commanded to their Children ſucceſſively, in caſe of their Apoſtacy, it's ſaid, <hi>this Song ſhall be Gods witneſs to teſtifie againſt them,</hi> Deut. 31. 19, 21, 26.</p>
